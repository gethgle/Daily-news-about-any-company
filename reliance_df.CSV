Zerodha users lose Rs 10 cr in lapsed Rights Entitlements since RIL issue; brokerage issues warning,Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/zerodha-users-lose-rs-10-cr-in-lapsed-rights-entitlements-since-ril-issue-brokerage-issues-warning/2217156/,"March 21, 2021 2:51 PM","Reliance Industries’ Rs 53,000-crore rights issue in May 2020 was the first in Indian share markets where shareholders were allowed to trade REs.
Rights Entitlements are credited in the Demat accounts of eligible shareholders of a company going through a rights issue.
Since May 2020, when Reliance Industries Ltd rights issue opened for subscription, customers of India’s largest brokerage firm Zerodha have lost Rs 10 crore in expired Rights Entitlements by not applying for shares. While most of this investor money was lost on account of the RIL rights issue, some was lost in other issues as well, Zerodha Founder and CEO Nithin Kamath said. “Most of this is Reliance Industries given the size of its rights issue but it includes the amount our clients lost for all rights issues since May 2020,” Nithin Kamath told Financial Express Online.
Earlier this week, Nithin Kamath took to Twitter to inform investors that his new-age brokerage will now warn investors, who wish to apply for Rights Entitlements (RE) on the platform, of the risks involved. “Many retail investors buy Rights Entitlements without knowing that the value of REs will be zero if they don’t apply,” Nithin Kamath said on Twitter. “Since May 2020 our clients have lost ~Rs 10 crore by buying Rights entitlements & not applying. We now have a nudge to warn customers,” he added.

Rights Entitlements are credited in the Demat accounts of eligible shareholders of a company going through a rights issue. Beneficiaries who do not wish to apply for the rights issue can sell their REs to other investors wanting to buy discounted shares in the corresponding rights issue. Reliance Industries’ Rs 53,000-crore rights issue in May 2020 was the first in Indian share markets where shareholders were allowed to trade REs.
The Rs 10 crore that Zerodha users have so far lost includes both: i) investors buying REs from eligible shareholders, but not applying for shares within the deadline, and ii) eligible shareholders neither applying for the rights issues using their REs, nor selling their REs in the stock market, Nithin Kamath told Financial Express Online. 
What are Rights Entitlements?
Rights Entitlements give an option to the holders to buy shares of the company at discounted prices, as agreed in the rights issue offer. REs are only credited in the Demat accounts of those customers who are eligible, according to the offer, and are issued in a specific ratio. In the Reliance Industries rights issue, the ratio was declared at 1:15. This meant that the investors would be issued one RE for every 15 shares owned. Capital markets regulator SEBI in January 2020 announced that REs will be tradable on the stock exchanges.

Eligible shareholders receive REs for no additional cost. “No money is charged to the shareholder receiving an entitlement in their account unless they subscribe to the issue at which point the process is similar to an IPO,” said Yug Tibrewal, Research Analyst, Choice Broking.
“The price of the RE is determined by the market based on the discount from the current market price of the security,” he added. For example, if a share is trading at Rs 10, and the company has offered stocks at a discounted price of Rs 8 in the rights issue, then the RE would be worth about Rs 2, or more or less depending on the demand.
REs continue to be traded till the rights issue is open. “Trading in RE shall begin on the date of opening of the issue and close at least four days prior to closure of the issue,” Makarand Joshi, partner, MMJC and Associates LLP – a corporate compliance – firm told Financial Express Online. If left unused, the RE lapses, according to SEBI norms.
What happens to unused REs
“If investors fail to exercise RE then they will lose the right to buy rights shares and consequently will lose the value at which they could have bought rights shares at a discounted price,” Makarand Joshi said. “If the REs are neither subscribed nor renounced then those right shares will never come into existence and accordingly market capitalisation will not increase to that extent.”
Further, the lapsed REs also work to the benefit of investors who want to apply for more shares than their RE credits. The lapsed REs are redistributed among the oversubscription to the rights issue, enabling investors to buy more shares than their RE holdings.

RIL affiliate picks three-fourth of gas from own CBM block at $6 price,The Hindu Businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ril-affiliate-picks-three-fourth-of-gas-from-own-cbm-block-at-6-price/article34122954.ece,"March 21, 2021","Reliance Industries Ltd has sold three-fourth of the gas from coal seams in Madhya Pradesh to an affiliate of the company at a price of just over $6 at current oil prices.
India Gas Solutions Private Limited, a 50: 50 joint venture of RIL and UK's bp, bought 0.62 million standard cubic meters per day out of 0.82 mmscmd gas bid out in an auction last week, three people with knowledge of the matter said.

State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd cornered 0.17 mmscmd while 0.03 mmscmd was picked by Reliance Gas Pipeline - the entity that transports gas from the coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks in Madhya Pradesh to consumers.
The price bid was 9.2 per cent of the prevailing rate of Brent crude oil price, which translated into a rate of over USD 6 per million British thermal units at current oil prices, they said.
An email sent to Reliance for comments remained unanswered.

Reliance had last month bids for 0.82 mmscmd of coal gas from the Sohagpur coal-bed methane (CBM) block for one year beginning April 1, 2021, according to a notice inviting offer (NIO).
Users were asked to quote a percentage of Brent crude oil price they will be willing to pay for the gas. Reliance initially set 9.5 per cent of Brent rate as the base or minimum price and asked bidders to ""enter bids that are higher than or equal to it."" It later lowered the base price to 8.7 per cent of Brent.
At the current USD 67 per barrel Brent crude oil price, the price of gas produced from coal seams, called CBM, comes to USD 6.1 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).
""A bidder shall be required to quote the variable denoted as 'V' in percentage terms as a positive number"" of the Dated Brent price, the notice said.
Gas price will be ""higher of (V per cent) x Dated Brent; or PPAC Price,"" it said.
PPAC price refers to the rate the government fixes every six months for gas produced mostly by state-owned firms such as ONGC. That price for the six months ending March 31, 2021 is USD 1.79 per mmBtu.
Reliance started commercial gas production from the CBM blocks in March 2017 and reached the peak of 3 mmscmd before the end of 2018.
CBM is natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95 per cent methane.
The pricing formula notified on Wednesday is a variation over the 2017 formula when Reliance had sought bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.
In that bidding for up to 3 mmscmd of gas, Reliance had outbid rivals including state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd to buy the entire volume.
Last month, Reliance and its partner BP plc of UK bid out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 block by pricing the fuel at JKM (Japan Korea Marker).
The JKM represents the price for spot LNG delivered in the Asian market and is now being widely used in the LNG industry as a marker for medium/ long term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.
In that auction, bidders were asked to ""quote the variable denoted as 'V' in USD per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) terms"".
""The gas price (in USD/mmBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM V,"" the bidding notice had said adding the 'V' could not be less than USD (-)0.30/mmBtu.
Reliance bought two-thirds of the volume in that auction."
Future Group Moves Division Bench of Delhi HC Against RIL Deal Restraining Order,News18,https://www.news18.com/news/business/future-group-moves-division-bench-of-delhi-hc-against-ril-deal-restraining-order-3557339.html,"LAST UPDATED:
MARCH 21, 2021, 12:10 IST","The Future Group has moved the division bench of the Delhi High Court against the order passed by the single-member bench, which has directed to stay its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries to sell its retail and wholesale business. The Kishore Biyani-led group firm, Future Retail Ltd (FRL) has now filed an appeal before the higher bench of the same High Court against the orders passed by a single-member bench of Justice J R Midha, Future Retail said in a regulatory filing.
“The company has filed an appeal before the High Court of Delhi against the impugned order dated March 18, 2021 passed by Single Judge…, said Future Retail. Earlier, in a statement on Friday, Future Retail had said the order of the single-member bench would have no impact on the ongoing proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is presently going through the scheme of arrangement between the Future Group and Reliance Retail.
The NCLT has reserved its order over the scheme of arrangement that entails the consolidation of Future Group’s retail and wholesale and transferring it to Reliance in a Rs 24,713 crore deal that was announced in August last year. The Future-Reliance deal, which is contested by global e-Commerce major Amazon, has already received clearance from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), SEBI and bourses, and the scheme of arrangement is now awaiting the nod from the NCLT and shareholders.
Passing a 134-page long judgement, Justice Midha had on Thursday directed Kishore Biyani-led FRL not to take further action on the deal with Reliance and held that the group willfully violated the EA’s order. The high court had rejected all the objections raised by the Future Group and imposed a cost of Rs 20 lakh on it as well as its directors.

Delhi HC Stays Direction to Maintain Status Quo on Future-Reliance Deal
It had directed them to deposit the amount in Prime Minister’s Relief Fund within two weeks for being used for providing COVID-19 vaccination to senior citizens of Below Poverty Line (BPL) category of Delhi. The high court’s judgement came on Amazon’s plea seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore’s EA on October 25, 2020, restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.
However, Future Retail had said: “We are advised that this order does not come in the way of the continuance of the ongoing NCLT proceedings, being inconsistent with the order dated February 22, 2021, of the Supreme Court,” said Future Retail. It is to be pointed out that the portions of the operative part of this detailed order, already covered by the ad-interim order dated February 2, 2021, has been stayed by the Division Bench of Delhi High Court in an appeal filed by Future Retail.
“Amazon has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the order passed by the Division Bench. The Supreme Court, in its order in Amazon’s appeal, has not vacated the stay granted by the Division Bench (which stay is still in operation). “The Supreme Court has directed that, in the meantime, the NCLT proceedings will be allowed to go on but will not culminate in any final order of sanction of scheme” Future Retail had said.
On August 29, 2020, the Future Group had announced that its retail and wholesale business would be sold to Reliance Retail, owned by oil-to-chemical conglomerate RIL in a Rs 24,713 crore deal. In October 2020, Amazon dragged Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.
Amazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US e-commerce giant dragged Future Group to arbitration at SIAC, arguing that the latter had violated their contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance. Amazon had invested in Future Coupons in August 2019 with an option of buying into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.
On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.

The court had also directed attachment of properties of Future Group’s promoters and directors along with a fine of Rs 20 lakh.

In a modification application on 11 March, Future Group has asked the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) to review its October interim ruling, two people with direct knowledge of the development said on condition of anonymity.

“Future Group has realized that due to the Singapore court’s order, Future Retail cannot proceed with the deal with Reliance Industries Ltd,"" said one of the two people. “The group’s application seeks an interim stay on the emergency arbitration order and removal of Future Retail from the scope of the order till the final outcome is decided.""
The latest plea is an attempt by Future Group to pave the way to complete the ₹24,713 crore asset sale deal with Reliance Industries.
The modification application in the Singapore tribunal follows the Delhi high court upholding the validity of the arbitration court’s order.
Amazon has challenged Future Group’s asset sale to Reliance Industries on the grounds that it violated a contract that Kishore Biyani entered with Amazon for an investment in a group company.
The cash-strapped Future Group is trying to expedite the deal to pay creditors and save the Big Bazaar retail chain from collapse.
Emails sent to spokespeople for Future Group, Amazon and Reliance Industries remained unanswered.

The real battle is, however, between Amazon and Reliance over a bigger slice of the Indian retail market that is estimated to exceed $1.3 trillion by 2025.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has made India a key focus of its global plans. Amazon fears that access to assets of Future Retail will give rival Reliance Retail a crucial edge in the battle for dominance of the Indian market.
The Reliance Industries-Future Group deal is still to get court clearance because of Amazon’s lawsuits against Future Group.
Amazon contends that Future Group can’t sell assets to 30 specified entities, including Reliance Industries, without the US company’s consent as per a commercial agreement signed in August 2019.
Future Group, which has been caught in the battle between Bezos and Ambani, has been struggling to repay around $3 billion worth of dues to lenders.
The Reliance Industries-Future Group deal is awaiting clearances from the Supreme Court and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) right now.
The case in the Supreme Court is scheduled to be heard on 19 March.
But even as the legal clearances are awaited, Reliance has extended operational support to Future Retail to prevent a deterioration in asset quality.
Reliance has also extended an internal deadline for the completion of the purchase by six months to accommodate for delays caused by the legal battle. Some of Future Retail’s lease agreements for stores have been transferred to Reliance to ease the burden on the troubled retailer and avoid defaults.
Integration of the workplaces of Reliance Retail and Future Group has also begun, and many Future Group employees have started undergoing training to work under Reliance Retail.
On 22 February, the Supreme Court directed NCLT not to approve the deal till it pronounces its final judgement.

RIL declines 6% in six days,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/ril-declines-6-in-six-days-121031700589_1.html,"Last Updated at March 17, 2021 14:16 IST","Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 1.71% to Rs 2064.45, extending decline for the sixth day in a row.
Shares of the index heavyweight have lost 5.78% in six sessions from its recent closing high of Rs 2,191.10 recorded on 8 March 2021.
In the past six months, the stock has declined by 10.20% while the benchmark Sensex had gained 28.48% during the same period.
On the technical front, the stock's RSI (relative strength index) stood at 46.424. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.
The stock was trading above its 50-day, 100-day and 200-day daily simple moving average (SMA) placed at 2022.79, 2003.50 and 2009.43, respectively.
Earlier this month, the conglomerate's telecom arm Reliance Jio Infocomm successfully acquired the right to use spectrum in all 22 circles across India in the recently concluded spectrum auctions conducted by Department of Telecommunications, Government of India.
With these acquisitions, Jio's total owned spectrum footprint has increased significantly, by 55%, to 1,717 MHz (uplink+ downlink).
RIL said that has very well-balanced spectrum for LTE Services and future upgradation to 5G Technology. Jio has achieved complete spectrum derisking with average validity of owned spectrum at 15.5 years.
RIL is India's largest private sector company. Its activities span hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and digital services.
On a consolidated basis, the company reported 12.5% rise in net profit to Rs 13,101 crore on 23.12% decline in net sales to Rs 117,860 crore in Q3 December 2020 over Q3 December 2019.

Analysts see the tide turning for Reliance Industries stock,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/analysts-see-the-tide-turning-for-reliance-industries-121031700419_1.html,"Last Updated at March 18, 2021 00:44 IST","Despite a massive underperformance at the bourses since the last six months, analysts are turning optimistic on Reliance Industries (RIL). Those at Jefferies, for instance, say that the company is a proxy play for India’s consumption growth story.
The key catalysts for the stock, according to a Jeffries note, include faster-than-expected market share gain in retail, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) stake sale, recovery in gross refining margins (GRM), potential public listing of Jio and even a possible banking licence going ahead. That apart, analysts feel any tariff hike in Reliance Jio (RJio) – its telecom venture – will also aid performance.
With balance sheet adequately de-levered, proceeds from a strategic stake sale in the O2C business will create a sizeable war chest for the company, analysts say.
“Revival in energy business profitability and moderation of capex in Jio turning it free cash flow (FCF) positive FY22E onwards will accrete to it. We project recurring FCF of over $6 billion per annum from FY22E,” the Jefferies note said.
Among 36 analysts’ recommendations on Bloomberg, 24 recommend buying the stock. The highest target price (best case) among them is Rs 2,900 – up around 38 per cent from the current levels. Meanwhile, 7 analysts recommend a 'hold', while 5 analysts recommend selling the stock.
At the bourses, however, the stock has been an underperformer – falling nearly 6 per cent since October 2020 as compared to 28 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Oil & Gas index and 32 per cent rally in the S&P BSE Sensex during this period, data show.
Telecom & gas verticals
RJio, analysts believe, should further consolidate its leadership position going ahead with 25 per cent EBITDA CAGR and gain 450 basis point (bps) revenue market share to 42 per cent by FY23E. With organised retail, only 12 per cent of overall retail and Reliance Retail (RR) bigger than the next 10 retailers combined, it is in pole position for growth leadership. Their contribution in consolidated EBITDA, analysts say, should increase from 37 per cent in FY20 to 49 per cent in FY23E.

The likely rise in gas consumption is another positive for the company. According to reports, India’s gas production has risen by 6 per cent, or 4.6 mmscmd, in the past two months to 82.3 mmscmd (January 2021) as gas output from eastern offshore fields rose 3.4x, or 4.4mmscmd. This, analysts say, has largely been on account of a ramp-up in production at the RIL-BP fields.

On the other hand, ONGC's output saw a 1 per cent decline to 6.2mmscmd over November 20 - January 2021 period. Production by Oil India / private onshore players rose a small 0.6/8.4 per cent YoY over the same period. The continuation of these initial signs of rising output, said analysts at CLSA, will help turn investors into believers of India’s gas production rebound story.
“Nearly all of the incremental rise in production at the eastern offshore fields was likely from ramp-up in output in the R-Cluster in KG-D6 block of RIL-BP that started in December 2020. RIL-BP expects its R Cluster field in KG-D6 to reach peak output of 12.9 mmscmd in 2021. Reliance and ONGC’s guidance suggests India’s domestic gas production will rise over 40 per cent in the next two-to-three years,” wrote Vikash Kumar Jain and Surajdev Yadav of CLSA in a March 4 note.
Those at JP Morgan, too, say there are ample catalysts for the stock. While any stake sale to Aramco would be positive, they say with O2C accounting for around 37 per cent of the consolidated enterprise value (EV), Jio Platforms (subs and ARPU) and Retail (JioMart roll out) should remain the key drivers for the stock. That said, they have maintained a neutral rating on the stock for now.

The success demonstrated by Indian startups in turning into unicorns (valued at $1 billion or more) and the massive global private equity investment drive in 2020 by Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 % brought record global investor interest to the country’s startup ecosystem in the pandemic year.

Despite geopolitical tensions halting Chinese investment, around 59 international investors made their first-time PE-VC investment in India in 2020, according to data analysed by consulting firm Praxis Global Alliance. This is a 37% rise in the number of global first-time investors who invested in Indian startups, given that the corresponding number stood at 43 in 2019.



Not only did Indian startups attract more foreign investors, they also saw larger bets and raised greater capital for the ecosystem in 2020. The top 10 new global investors in 2020 participated in around $7 billion worth of deals, while this was only $1.2 billion in 2019, data showed. This includes co-investment by other players in the same deals.

There were sovereign funds like Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which pooled almost $4 billion into RIL’s fund-raising for its group companies. Other instances of global firms tapping India included Luxor Capital Group’s investment in Zomato, Alkeon Capital’s backing of Byju’s, and South Korea’s NXC Corporation investing in DMI Finance.

International investment came in from over 15 countries. Of these, 60% investors had their headquarters in the US, followed by 7% who had their headquarters in Japan and South Korea each. The Middle East region was another major investor base. The investment deals by such first-time international backers were highest in consumer apps and platforms (14 deals) followed by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) & Artificial Intelligence (AI) at 11 deals.

Praxis Global Alliance managing partner and CEO Madhur Singhal said Indian internet companies are scaling up rapidly, prompting global investors to participate in the ecosystem’s growth. “Also, many experienced India fund managers at global investment firms who understand the nuances of the startups here have turned entrepreneurs and set up their own funds,” he added.

As of December 2020, India was home to 37 unicorns with 14 companies making it to the elite list in the pandemic year alone."

Sensex sheds 397 points today: Five key factors behind the fall,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/monday-mayhem-factors-behind-sensex-s-900-point-crash-today-121031500458_1.html,"Last Updated at March 15, 2021 15:38 IST","Sensex Today: The equity benchmark indices declined for the second straight day on Monday. The fall comes on the back of weak macroeconomic data (dip in IIP, rise in inflation) and resurgence in Covid-19 infections. Besides, elevated crude prices and jump in bond yields also weighed on sentiment.
The BSE benchmark Sensex after shedding nearly 1,000 points in intra-day, recouped losses amid a strong start for Eupropean shares and ended 397 points down at 50,395. While its NSE counterpart Nifty shed 101 points to end at 14,930.
Weakness in index heavyweight Reliance Industries and banking and financial stocks was what dragged indices lower.
The rout also engulfed the broader markets as they declined in tandem with the benchmark. The Nifty Midcap100, Smallcap100 and the broadest Nifty500 were all down nearly 1 per cent each.

""Markets opened in the red on the back of weak cues and drifted lower on higher WPI and partial lockdown in certain states. However, a spirited rally in metals & IT stocks in afternoon Trade with support from financials helped Indices recoup part of the losses,"" said S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities.
Here are the key factors that dragged markets lower on Monday.
Concerns on macro print
The weak macroeconomic print spooked investors who have been ploughing money into the market amid hopes of a strong economic recovery. In a double whammy for the economy, industrial production growth re-entered the negative territory by contracting 1.6 per cent in January, while retail inflation soared to a three-month high of 5.03 per cent in February on costlier food items. That apart, WPI inflation came in at 4.17 per cent in February, up 2.03 per cent from January.
""Looking ahead, we expect large upticks in the WPI inflation over the next three months, as the wedge between the commodity prices and their year-ago level intensifies. We expect the headline and core WPI inflation to rise to around 6 per cent each in March 2021. Subsequently, we expect the headline WPI inflation to harden further to between 9-9.5 per cent , and the core-WPI inflation to climb to 7-7.5 per cent by May 2021, before displaying a more gradual moderation to 4 per cent each by the end of 2021,"" said Aditi Nayar, vice-president and principal economist at ICRA.
Rising bond yields
The 10-year US Treasuries yield stood at 1.634 per cent, having risen to as high as 1.642 per cent on Friday, a high last seen in February last year. A spike in bond yields does not bode well for emerging markets like India as investors shun riskier assets in their favour.
Amid this backdrop, investors would keep an eye on US Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting, slated for March 16-17, to understand how the US central bank plans to tackle the volatility in the bond yields.
Oil on a boil
Besides, rising yields, a flare-up in crude prices is another worry for markets. After rising to $71 barrel last week, Brent crude was hovering close to the $70 a barrel mark amid output cuts from major producers and optimism about global economic recovery. Oil prices will continue to be closely watched as India is one of the biggest oil importers in the world.
Covid fears return
India recorded 26,291 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, its highest single-day spike in 85 days, taking the country's infection tally to 1,13,85,339, according to Union Health Ministry data. With 118 new fatalities, Covid-19 death toll reached 158,725, or 1.40 per cent of total confirmed infections. While the inoculation drive could soothe investors' concerns, the latest concerns surrounding the AstraZeneca vaccine and suspension of its use in some nations in Europe could prove to be a setback if authorities in India decide to follow suit. Besides, sporadic lockdowns also pose the threat to already fragile Indian economic recovery.
Weakness in global markets
Asian stocks reversed gains and dipped while the US and European equity futures were mixed as liquidity concerns weighed on Chinese shares and benchmark Treasury yields traded around a one-year high. Chinese shares extended declines on concern the nation’s economic recovery portends less accommodative monetary policy, Bloomberg reported.
Japan’s Topix index rose 0.9 per cent while South Korea’s Kospi index shed 0.3 per cent and China’s CSI 300 Index fell 2.7 per cent. S&P 500 futures also declined, indicating a weak start for US markets later today."

He'll be presented before a court in connection with an explosive (gelatin sticks)-laden SUV, which was found near Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani's house on February 25. The police also found a letter in the SUV, warning the Ambanis that ""it's a trailer and the big picture is yet to come"".
Assistant Police Inspector Vaze was also the first investigating officer in the Ambani bomb scare case but was removed as the probe in the case was later taken over by the NIA.
The NIA spokesperson said Vaze has been held for this ""role and involvement in placing an explosives-laden vehicle near Carmichael Road on February 25"".
He has been arrested under Sections 286 (Negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 465 (Punishment for forgery), 473 (Making or possessing counterfeit seal), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code and 4(a)(b)(I)(attempt to cause an explosion) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.

Vaze is also being probed for his alleged role in the death of Mansukh Hiran, the SUV owner, who was found dead in a creek in the Thane district on March 5.
The ATS team investigating the death of Manuskh Hiren had registered an FIR against Vaze following a complaint made by Hiren's wife Vimla. The sessions court is expected to conduct the hearing for the anticipatory bail application on March 19.
The Maharashtra ATS on Friday had recorded statements of Mansukh Hiren's brother Vinod and son Meet. Manuskh Hiren's death is still clouded in mystery. Hiren was an auto-parts dealer whose dead body was discovered in a Thane creek on March 5.
ATS had called Meet and Hiren's wife Vimla for questioning on Wednesday. In her statement, Vimla told the officers that the then investigating officer in the case, Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze, was involved in Hiren's murder. Vaze was transferred from the Mumbai Crime Branch to the Special Branch on March 12.
Vimla further revealed that the SUV in question had been used by Vaze between November 2020 and February 5, 2021. Vaze had denied the claims made by Hiren's wife.
On Saturday morning, Vaze put up a cryptic WhatsApp status saying that ""I think the time to say goodbye to the world is coming closer"". In the status, Vaze alleged that his fellow officers are trying to falsely implicate him in the case and that this has happened to him before in 2004.

A Reuters special report last month revealed that Amazon has for years given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its India platform and used them to circumvent the country's foreign investment rules.
The latest draft of the policy document says operators should be impartial in their dealings with sellers.
""E-commerce operators must ensure equal treatment of all sellers/vendors registered on their platforms and not adopt algorithms which result in prioritizing select vendors/sellers,"" it says.
A spokesman for the commerce ministry declined to comment.
The policy will apply to Amazon and Flipkart - two top e-commerce players in India - as well as domestic players like Reliance Industries, which has plans to expand its JioMart online platform. All three firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Separately, India is also considering changes to foreign investment rules that could prompt players including Amazon to restructure their ties with some major sellers, Reuters reported in January.

On Saturday, top government officials from various departments, including the commerce ministry, met to discuss the e-commerce policy. The timeline of publication and whether it will be subject to further changes were not immediately clear.
Indian traders have also complained about steep discounts offered by online companies which smaller retailers have not been able to match. Amazon and Flipkart have said they comply with all laws.
E-commerce firms must ""bring out clear and transparent policies"" on online discounts, the draft document says.
The Reuters special report last month - based on internal Amazon documents dated between 2012 and 2019 - showed the company helped a small number of sellers prosper on its India platform, giving them discounted fees and helping one cut special deals with big tech manufacturers.
Amazon has said it ""does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace,"" and that it ""treats all sellers in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner.""

9:35 am:Nifty Outlook by Geojit Financial Services
""Though we had opened the week on a tentative note, we were clear not to entertain the possibilities of a crash. On Tuesday, we had a much better clarity on the direction, and brought 15900 in our radar. By Wednesday we were clear of a new peak soon, but were watchful of a few episodes of confidence crises once near/inside the 15250-431 region, which is where we are likely to be in, today. A breakout beyond this congestion region of 15250-431 is to be expected, but it is uncertain how far the bulls would be keen to chase on a Friday. Towards this end, we would go in with a limited upside objective of 15550 today, a very conservative one for a new-peak-move, and would be watchful of loss in momentum.""
9:25 am:  Expert view on market from Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services
""The 'risk on' in global equity markets got another push with the passage of the US $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus. Nifty is again likely to reach record highs since SGX Nifty is indicating 15400 levels. IT has been leading this leg of the rally. Now financials may catch up. Buy on dips' has been a successful strategy so far. Now, since markets have run too much, at around 15400 Nifty, it is better to take a pause rather than buy. Partial profit booking also may be considered. The market has high resilience and the momentum is favourable but valuations and risks are high.""

Viacom18’s Voot Select crosses one million active paying subscribers,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-bytes/viacom18s-voot-select-crosses-one-million-active-paying-subscribers/articleshow/81459537.cms,"Last Updated: Mar 12, 2021, 02:16 PM IST","Viacom18's subscription-based video streaming service Voot Select has said it has crossed one million active paying subscribers nearly a year after its debut, benefiting from the growth in online video consumption during the pandemic-induced lockdown last year.

Viacom18, in which Reliance Industries owns a majority stake, had launched the subscription service in March 2020, entering a crowded local market with players like Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, Essel Group's ZEE5, and Sony Pictures Network's SonyLIV. Prior to this, the service operated on a free ad-supported model, similar to Times Internet’s* MX Player.

""The velocity has surprised us. We just grew a lot quicker than we thought we would, which is partly attributable to the lockdown and people having more time to consume entertainment and no fresh TV content,"" Ferzad Palia, Head – Voot Select and International Business at Viacom18, told ETtech.

In addition to this milestone, Voot Select said it will now be the exclusive home for the upcoming shows from US media conglomerate ViacomCBS's recently launched streaming service Paramount+ and American television network Showtime. This includes titles like Dexter's new limited series, The First Lady, Frasier (Reboot), Why Women Kill (second season) and Ray Donovan movie. ""We will also scale up our investments in marquee international content that is relevant to the Indian market,"" Palia said.

Viacom18 will also be ramping up its investments in local original programming this year, with plans to shortly foray into regional originals.

""Originals is one of the key focus areas for us for the Indian and international markets and we are looking at a 2x-3x jump in our content budget this fiscal. We plan to release about 12 Hindi originals and a similar number of regional originals over the next year"" Palia said. However, he declined to disclose further details on the service's content investments. Voot Select has released about seven Hindi originals since last year.

Earlier this month, Netflix had also announced its largest-ever programming slate in India, with more than 40 original titles expected to debut on the service over the next year.

Digital extensions

Apart from original programming, Palia said they are also experimenting with building digital extensions for its marquee television properties in a bid to attract television watching audience to its platform.

For instance, Voot Select recently offered 24 hours live feed of its reality show Big Boss on the platform and is also launching an extension for its popular dating reality television show Splitsvilla called Wild Villa that will be a Voot Select exclusive and will run simultaneously along with the television programme.

The service will also debut a new set of episodes for one of its television show 'Ishq Mein Marjawan' starting next week, after its television run ends on Saturday. ""It's a very core part of the way we see our future. Hence, we will double down on it."" Palia said.

Voot Select currently offers subscribers access to its television content 24 hours before it is aired on television, which Palia said, has been one of the key drivers for its customer acquisition in the past year.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth ₹2,801.87 crore on Tuesday and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought a net of  ₹1,250.22 crore, as per exchange data.
According to V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, in this see-saw game in the market, bulls and bears are giving up and regaining their dominance in tune with macro trends.
""A rise in bond yields temporarily strengthens the bears, and when yields fall, bulls come back strongly. Now it appears that the US 10-year bond yield is likely to consolidate in the 1.5-1.6 per cent range for the short-term.
FIIs are back to buying mode, he said, adding that this along with DII buying is likely to impart strength to the market."

The Mukesh Ambani-led company has also extended an internal deadline for completion of the purchase by six months to accommodate for delays caused by a legal battle between Future Group and Amazon.com Inc., the people said on condition of anonymity, citing legal sensitivity. Firms usually set aside 3-9 months, depending on the transaction’s complexity, to secure regulatory approvals.

“Due to the ongoing legal battle with Amazon, it is impossible to get all the regulatory nods before May, which is why the deadline has been extended further by at least six months,"" said one of the two people cited above.
Some of Future Retail’s lease agreements for stores have, however, been transferred to Reliance to ease the burden on the troubled retailer and avoid defaults.
“The lease/rental agreements with a number of landlords for several Future Group retail, Big Bazaar and fbb stores in some of the metro cities and tier-II locations have already been transferred in the name of Reliance Industries Group companies from Future Group,"" said the first person.
Spokespeople for Reliance Industries, Future Group and Amazon India didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.

Future Group has 1,500 Big Bazaar and fbb stores in India, with around 70,000 people working in them.
Apart from transferring rental agreements in the name of RIL group entities, integration of the workplaces of Reliance Retail and Future Group has also begun, the people cited above said.
“Many existing workers of Future Group have started undergoing training to be ready to work under Reliance Retail. Re-branding exercises and soft-launch plans are going on at full throttle so that everyone from both the groups is ready on the date when all the regulatory approvals come in,"" said the first person.
India’s company law tribunal will now likely spell its verdict on the RIL-Future deal next week. The deal entails a scheme of amalgamation of six Future Group companies and the subsequent sale of retail, wholesale, warehousing and logistics assets to two subsidiaries of Reliance Industries.
In an interim order on 22 February, the Supreme Court halted the deal and stopped NCLT from approving the transaction till further orders. An NCLT approval is a must for this deal to go through. The Supreme Court will hear the matter again on 19 March, said a third person familiar with the ongoing developments.
According to the Supreme Court order, NCLT can allow the Future Group to take operational steps towards the proposed RIL-Future deal but can’t let Future Group hold any board meeting of Future Retail for final clearance of the deal or seek shareholders’ approval until the final verdict.
If the NCLT reserves its nod for the scheme of amalgamation and also restrains RIL and Future Group from taking any step towards the deal, it may further delay the sale to Reliance.
“If Future is unable to secure all regulatory approvals within a certain deadline, RIL has the right to walk away from the deal,"" said the second person.
Such a scenario may aggravate problems for the Future Group, which has been struggling to repay $2.5 billion worth of dues to lenders. “This is why RIL has agreed to extend its operational and ground-level support to Future Group. In the meantime, the two parties can ready themselves for the re-launch of retail businesses of Future Group,"" said the second person.
Future Group lawyers have argued that the RIL-Future deal is crucial to saving the Future Group and thousands of employees’ livelihoods. On 3 March, Mint reported that Amazon offered a revival plan for Future to save it from going bankrupt.

“Micro, small and medium businesses are the bedrock of Indian economy. Currently, in the absence of an integrated digital services offering and the knowhow to adopt advanced enterprise offerings, they are unable to leverage the power of digital technologies to run their businesses efficiently,” RJio Director Akash Ambani said.
“JioBusiness will bridge this gap by providing integrated enterprise-grade voice and data services, digital solutions and devices, to small businesses. These solutions will help them run their business efficiently and compete with larger enterprises,” he added.
Currently, a micro and small business spends about ₹15,000-20,000 per month for connectivity, productivity and automation tools.

“The intent is to acquire stakes and emerge among the top 20 companies in the world. The acquisition could be a minority, majority or entire holding in a company, depending on the price and valuation. While the intention is to ramp up capabilities, finalising a deal would depend on the opportunities available, and there can no certainty of closure of many deals this year,” a source close to the development said.
RIL has an option to increase its stake in companies where it had made a partial acquisition, and the company is expected to exercise it, he added.

IT service providers such as Infosys, Accenture and Tata Consultancy Services have already said they would cover the vaccination cost of employees and their dependents. Some startups, including educational technology firm upGrad, are also reportedly planning to pay for the vaccinations.

India scaled up its vaccination programme from Monday by opening it up to people over the age of 60, and individuals above 45 suffering from comorbidities. While the vaccinations are free at government hospitals, at private hospitals the rate has been fixed at Rs 250 per dose.

In the letter, Nita Ambani, nonexecutive director of RIL, urged employees to register for the government’s vaccination programme if they are eligible.

“With your support, we will soon be able to put the pandemic behind us. Until then, please do not let your guard down against the scourge of the coronavirus just yet. Continue to maintain utmost safety and hygiene precautions. We are in the last stages of the collective battle. Together we must win, and we will win,” Ambani said.

Prior to this, on Reliance Family Day 2020, chairman Mukesh Ambani and wife Nita had made a commitment to employees that as soon as a vaccine was available in India, the conglomerate would plan for early vaccination for all employees and their family members.

In January, diversified conglomerate Mahindra Group and consumer goods major ITC also said that they may source Covid-19 vaccines for employees.

“At present, we are awaiting policy clarity on vaccine allocation to private sector employees. Employee health and wellness remains a top priority for the organization,” said S Venkatesh, group president - human resources, RPG Enterprises.

“A senior leadership task force has been set up who are engaged in discussions with manufacturers to finalise modalities of administering vaccines for approximately 25,000 employees across Group companies in India,” Venkatesh added.

RIL has over 1.95 lakh employees across businesses."

He was speaking in the state Legislative Assembly on the issue of the law and order situation in the state.

Fadnavis said there are a number of coincidences that lead to suspicion in the Ambani threat case.

The owner of the vehicle and a police official had a telephonic conversation as well, the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly said.

""That police official was the first to reach the spot outside Ambani's residence instead of the personnel of the local police station and crime branch officials,"" Fadnavis said.

The former chief minister said the owner left the vehicle in Thane and came to Crawford Market in south Mumbai, which is close to the police commissionarate.

""The owner of the vehicle met a person at Crawford Market. Who is that? The vehicle owner lives in Thane and the police official who was the first to reach the spot also lives in Thane,"" he said.

""So many coincidences lead to suspicion and hence the probe must by handed over to the NIA,"" he said.

Fadnavis also said it was the duty of the government to ensure there is no threat to the lifeof the owner of the vehicle.

Posting its biggest single-day gain since February 2, the benchmark Sensex rose 1,147 points, or 2.3 per cent, to end the session at 51,444. The index is now less than 710 points, or 1.38 per cent shy of its previous all-time closing high of 52,154 on February 15.
The Nifty50 index rose 326 points, or 2.2 per cent, to end the session at 15,245. In the past three sessions, India’s market cap has jumped by over Rs 10 trillion.
All the Sensex components, barring three, ended the session with gains.
Bajaj Finserv was the best-performing Sensex stock, rising 5.2 per cent; Reliance Industries and Bajaj Finance surged 4.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively. Reliance alone made a 281-point contribution to Sensex’s 1,148-point gain.
All the BSE sectoral indices, barring one, ended the sessions with gains. Energy and metal stocks gained the most, and their gauges rose 3.7 and 3.2 per cent, respectively.

Maruti, Bajaj Auto, and Mahindra & Mahindra were the only Sensex stocks to end the session with losses; they declined 1.3 per cent, 1.2 per cent, and 0.9 per cent, respectively. The rise in bond yields eased after central bankers across the world assured that their accommodative monetary policy would continue. Some regions, such as Australia, even increased bond purchases to keep a lid on borrowing costs.

“After last week’s shock, policymakers across the globe are easing everyone’s nerves. And there is no extra data at the moment to support inflation argument,” said Andrew Holland, CEO, Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies.
Surging bond yields had rattled the equity markets last week with the Sensex and the Nifty crashing 4 per cent on Friday. Investors were worried that the economic recovery and comfortable monetary conditions would fuel inflation, forcing central bankers to reconsider the easy monetary policy.
On Wednesday, the 10-year US Treasury note traded at around 1.45 per cent after briefly slipping below 1.40 per cent. Last week, the yield had surged to as much as 1.61 per cent, triggering a flight to safety among investors.
However, foreign portfolio investors’ (FPIs’) appetite for risk has made a strong comeback. On Wednesday, they pumped in more than Rs 2,000 crore for a second straight day.
Experts said the $1.9-trillion stimulus package approved by the House of Representatives in the US and the promise of more relief measures by other nations have boosted confidence in an economic revival."

A letter found inside the SUV purportedly threatened Ambani and his family.

Police had ruled out a terror angle during the probe conducted so far.

The crime branch has formed more than 10 teams, including special units, to crack the case, the officer said, adding that statements of over 30 persons have been recorded so far.

Police teams are trying to track down the Innova car in which the driver of the parked Scorpio SUV with explosives was seen leaving.

On the other hand, Vodafone Idea acquired just 11.8 MHz of spectrum to cover minor gaps in five circles. “Bharti and Jio picked up a significant share of the spectrum on offer across key bands to cover up for the bandwidth expiring later this year, while also preparing to expand their coverage as well as capacity across the country. On the other hand, VIL increased its holding marginally on an already large spectrum portfolio,” said analysts at Kotak Securities in a note. 
Decoding the spectrum sales, Motilal Oswal said that Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel’s purchase could be owing to the renewal of existing spectrum, investment in lower bands to deepen coverage, and investment in capacity bands to de-bottleneck networks and prepare for a seamless switch to 5G in the future. “VIL’s low participation is evident from its weak liquidity. Its huge debt leaves limited options,” they added. Vodafone Idea’s purchase was 76% lower than what it was required to shell out for renewal of spectrum.
Reliance introduces new JioPhone plans
Prior to the spectrum auction, Reliance Industries-owned Jio, announced its new 4G feature phone, offering plans with 12 and 24 months of recharge and monthly data allowance of 2GB, worth Rs1,499 and Rs1,999. “In our view, the offer is unlikely to see meaningful traction given 1.9x-2.6x increase in upfront cost,” analysts at Credit Suisse said. Those Goldman Sachs too hold a similar view.
Upfront cost in the new plans unveiled by Jio would limit any change in the segment. Credit Suisse said that upfront cost plays an important role, given the affordability constraints. “Overall, we believe that the new offer is unlikely to have a material impact on Airtel and Vodafone Idea. If at all, Vodafone Idea would be more prone to subscriber loss given the higher share of low-end feature phone subscribers.

RIL gains after Jio raises spectrum holding by 55%,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/ril-gains-after-jio-raises-spectrum-holding-by-55-121030300264_1.html,"Last Updated at March 3, 2021 10:04 IST","Reliance Industries (RIL) rose 1.22% to Rs 2132 after the company said that its telecom unit Reliance Jio has successfully acquired the right to use spectrum in all 22 circles across India.
In a BSE filing made after market hours on Tuesday (2 March 2021), RIL said that Reliance Jio Infocomm, a subsidiary of the company, had successfully acquired the right to use spectrum in all 22 circles across India in the recently concluded spectrum auctions conducted by Department of Telecommunications, Government of India.
RIL said that the payment to be made for the right to use this technology agnostic spectrum for a period of 20 years is Rs 57,123 crore. For the spectrum bought, Jio will have to make an upfront payment of Rs 19,939 crore and deferred payment of Rs 37,184 crore. As per terms of the spectrum auction, the deferred payments have to be made over a period of 18 years (2 year moratorium plus 16 year repayment period), with interest computed at 7.3% per annum.
The conglomerate said that Jio has very well-balanced spectrum for LTE Services and future upgradation to 5G Technology. Jio has achieved complete spectrum derisking with average validity of owned spectrum at 15.5 years.
With these acquisitions, Jio's total owned spectrum footprint has increased significantly, by 55%, to 1,717 MHz (uplink+ downlink). The spectrum has been acquired at an effective cost of Rs 60.8 crore per MHz. The acquired spectrum can be utilised for transition to 5G services at the appropriate time, where Jio has developed its own 5G stack, it added.
Mukesh D Ambani, chairman, Reliance Industries, said, ""Jio has revolutionised the digital landscape of India with the country becoming the fastest adopter of Digital Life. We want to ensure that we keep on enhancing experiences, not only for our existing customers, but also for the next 300 million users that will move to digital services. With our increased spectrum footprint, we are ready to further expand the digital footprint in India as well as get ourselves ready for the imminent 5G rollout.""
RIL is India's largest private sector company. Its activities span hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and digital services.
On a consolidated basis, RIL reported 12.5% rise in net profit to Rs 13,101 crore on 23.12% decline in net sales to Rs 117,860 crore in Q3 December 2020 over Q3 December 2019.

Several big businesses are in fray for setting up NUE. What is it?,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/several-big-businesses-are-in-fray-for-setting-up-nue-what-is-it-121030201183_1.html,"Last Updated at March 2, 2021 19:53 IST","As digital payments in India continue to grow, several prominent business establishments in India including Reliance Industries, the Tata Group and digital payments major Paytm are reportedly in fray for setting up New Umbrella Entity (NUE) for retail payments.
Moreover, several global tech giants including Facebook, Google and Amazon have tied up with Indian organisations for being a part of such an entity which would rival the likes of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
But what is the NUE licence that a number of big businesses are vying for?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) came up with a framework for the pan-India umbrella entity for retail payments back in August 2020, wherein the central bank said that an entity must have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 500 crore.
The RBI notification said that the objective of the framework is to set up pan-India umbrella entity or entities focussing on retail payment systems.
""Such entity shall be a Company incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013 and may be a 'for-profit' or a Section 8 Company as may be decided by it,"" it said.
No single promoter or promoter group shall have more than 40 per cent investment in the capital of the umbrella entity.
""The promoters/promoter groups shall upfront demonstrate capital contribution of not less than 10 per cent, i.e., Rs 50 crore at the time of making an application for setting up of the umbrella entity,"" it said, adding that the balance capital shall be secured at the time of commencement of business or operations.
The promoter shareholding can be diluted to a minimum of 25 per cent after five years of the commencement of business of the umbrella entity and a minimum net worth of Rs 300 crore shall be maintained at all times.
The RBI said that the umbrella entity shall conform to the norms of corporate governance along with 'fit and proper' criteria for persons to be appointed on its board.
The guidelines said that the RBI retains the right to approve the appointment of directors as also to nominate a member on the board of the umbrella entity.
The apex bank has initially sought applications from the interested parties by the close of business hours on February 26 of this year, but the deadline was reportedly extended to March 31, 2021.

At the same time, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk ranked first with a net worth of $197 billion.
But a top 10 rank in the list of the world's wealthiest is not the only thing that the two have in common. Ambani’s Reliance Industries recently acquired a US-based transportation company developing pod taxis. While not a new investment for the company's subsidiary Reliance Strategic Business Ventures, RIL announced at the end of February that it had bought an additional stake in skyTran for $ 26.76 million. Its total stake in the company now stands at 54.5%.
But even as Ambani appears to be looking westward and onto the future with investments into the futuristic technology, Elon Musk and fellow investor in futuristic ventures appears to be turning to India. skyTran's work is rather similar to the Hyperloop conceptualised by Musk - a technological advance that is currently being implemented in India.
5
Put simply, Hyperloop contemplates a system of sealed tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance at great speeds. Multiple hyperloop projects are presently ongoing in India. This includes the Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop that would reduce the travel time between the two cities drastically. While the plans remain somewhat hypothetical still, some including Pune engineer Tanay Manjrekar have test travelled on Virgin Hyperloop's test loop.
Incidentally Reliance also recently announced its intention to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. This announcement came soon after Elon Musk's Tesla began prepping for an entry into the Indian market later this year.
""Our acquiring majority equity stake in skyTran reflects our commitment to invest in building futuristic technologies that would transform the world. We are excited by skyTran’s potential to achieve an order of magnitude impact on highspeed intra and inter-city connectivity and its ability to provide a high speed, highly efficient and economical ‘Transportation-As-A-Service’ platform for India and the Rest of the World,"" a regulatory filing with BSE quoted Ambani as saying."

""India's largest exporter, Reliance accounts for 8 per cent of the country's exports and 5 per cent of India's total revenues from customs and excise duty. Reliance is planning a calculated shift to renewable energy and has decided to venture into the battery-making business ahead of the electric vehicle boom,"" said the Hurun statement.

Mukesh Ambani continued to be the wealthiest Indian with a net worth of USD 83 billion. The head of Reliance Industries witnessed a 24 per cent jump in fortunes and climbed up one spot to be the eighth richest globally, as per the Hurun Global Rich List.

Gautam Adani from Gujarat, who has had a spectacular rise in fortunes in the last few years, saw his wealth almost doubling to USD 32 billion in 2020 and climbed 20 places to be the 48th richest person globally and the second wealthiest Indian. His brother Vinod's wealth grew 128 per cent to USD 9.8 billion.

The report compiles individual or family wealth in the year to January 15. It can be noted that the Indian economy is set to contract by over 7 per cent because of the impact of the pandemic, which had forced governments to go for lockdowns that had a debilitating impact on the poor.

The report comes at a time when concerns are being raised about a 'K-shaped' recovery being underway, where a select few prosper.

Hurun India's Managing Director and Chief Researcher Anas Rahman Junaid said Indian wealth creation is dominated by cyclical or traditional industries compared to tech-driven wealth creation in the US and China.

""When the tech-driven wealth creation reaches full potential, India could potentially beat USA in terms of the number of billionaires,"" he added.

IT company HCL's Shiv Nadar was the third wealthiest Indian with a fortune of USD 27 billion while some peers in the tech industry dominated the list of fastest growing wealth.

Jay Chaudhry of software company Zcaler saw a 274 per cent rise in networth to USD 13 billion during the year while Byju Raveendran and family saw a 100 per cent increase in its wealth to USD 2.8 billion, the report said.

Diversified corporate house Mahindra Group's head Anand Mahindra and family also saw a 100 per cent increase in wealth to USD 2.4 billion, it said.

Among those who saw a decline in their networth during the year was Acharya Balkrishna of Patanjali Ayurved at USD3.6 billion, down 32 per cent.

The financial capital continues to lead in the country from a concentration perspective, being home to 60 of the 177 Indian billionaires, followed by New Delhi at 40 and Bengaluru at 22 billionaires, it said.

From a gender perspective, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of Biocon leads with a networth of USD 4.8 billion (up 41 per cent), Smita V Crishna of Godrej at USD 4.7 billion and Lupin's Manju Gupta at USD 3.3 billion.

A majority of 118 billionaires were classified as self-made ones in the ranking, as against 932 of the 1,058 billionaires in neighbouring China, which is home to the highest number of billionaires.

Globally, the list is led by Elon Musk of Tesla with a fortune of USD 197 billion followed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos at USD 189 billion and Frenchman Bernard Arnault of fashion house LVMH at USD 114 billion."

RIL, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, raised its holding in SkyTran to 54.46% from 26.3% on a fully diluted basis for $26.76 million, the Mumbai-based company said in a regulatory filing. The stake is held by RIL’s unit Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Ltd.
SkyTran is a venture-funded developer of pod car transport systems. Pod taxi is a driverless personal rapid transit system, which runs along a predetermined course either through overhead suspension or magnetic levitation.
Founded in 2011, SkyTran aims to solve traffic congestion globally by creating a high-speed, scalable and low-cost transport system. It has partnered with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) in the US and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).
RIL first invested in SkyTran in October 2018, taking a 12.7% stake in the company. In November 2019, it raised the stake to 17.37% and in April 2020, to 26.3%. “Our acquiring a majority equity stake in SkyTran reflects our commitment to investing in building futuristic technologies that would transform the world,” said Ambani, RIL’s chairman and managing director.

The acquisition of a majority stake in the technology company that develops pod car transport systems is a part of the company’s strategy to use Reliance Industries as a platform to develop new technologies.

He said that non-polluting, high speed personal rapid transportation systems will help facilitate environmental sustainability through efficient use of alternative energy and make an impactful reduction in air and noise pollution.

RIL is believed to be keen to develop India’s first pod taxi prototype, a driverless personal rapid transit system that runs on overhead suspension or magnetic levitation. The government had given a green signal to test three of these rapid transport systems in 2017.

He overtook China's Zhong Shanshan, whose bottled-water company tanked a record 20% this week.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Chinese tycoon is worth $76.6 billion, down more than $22 billion from a peak just last week. Ambani, on the other hand, has a net worth of about $80 billion.
Despite a brutal week for markets, Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd. was relatively unscathed as it said it would spin off its oil-to-chemicals business into an independent unit, reported Bloomberg. ""Ambani has focused on pivoting his empire to tech and e-commerce, moving away from energy. Last year, he sold stakes in Reliance’s digital and retail units worth $27 billion to investors including Google and Facebook Inc., lifting his fortune by $18 billion. The spin off announced this week of the oil-to-chemicals unit -- which accounted for more than 60% of the conglomerate’s revenue in the last fiscal year -- will help the tycoon bring in more investors and expedite a proposed stake sale to Saudi Arabian Oil Co,"" the report added.
For the past two years, Mukesh Ambani was Asia's richest person. However, he was overtaken by Zhong Shanshan recently. Shanshan, also known as China's bottled-water king, was sixth-wealthiest person on Earth by early 2021. Two major factors behind the surge in Shanshan's wealth are the mega listings of his vaccine manufacturing company Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co in April followed by that of his bottled water company Nongfu on the stock markets."

For the past two years, Ambani held the numero uno position in the ranking of Asia's richest people. But Shanshan bagged the title from the RIL chairman after the listing of his two companies. By early 2021, the Chinese tycoon was the sixth-wealthiest person on earth.
Shanshan's Nongfu Spring Co. more than tripled to a peak in January this year, whereas his Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co. swelled by 3,757 per cent.

Reliance Industries prices coal gas from Madhya Pradesh at minimum $6,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/reliance-industries-prices-coal-gas-from-madhya-pradesh-at-minimum-6-121022400920_1.html,"Last Updated at February 24, 2021 16:56 IST","Reliance Industries Ltd on Wednesday sought bids from buyers of coal gas it produces from CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh at a minimum price of about USD 6 at the current oil price.
Reliance sought bids for 0.82 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the Sohagpur coal-bed methane (CBM) block, according to a notice inviting offer (NIO).
Bids have been sought for supply of gas, which can be used in industries as fuel or feedstock as well as by city gas operators for supply as CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households, for one year beginning April 1, 2021.
Users have been asked to quote a percentage of Brent crude oil price they will be willing to pay for the gas.
Reliance set 9.5 per cent of Brent rate as the base or minimum price and asked bidders to ""enter bids that are higher than or equal to it.""

At the current USD 65 per barrel Brent crude oil price, the price of gas produced from coal seams, called CBM, comes to USD 6.17 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).
""A bidder shall be required to quote the variable denoted as 'V' in percentage terms as a positive number"" of the Dated Brent price, the notice said.
Gas price will be ""higher of (V per cent) x Dated Brent; or PPAC Price,"" it said.
PPAC price refers to therate the government fixes every six months for gas produced mostly by state-owned firms such as ONGC. That price for the six months ending March 31, 2021 is USD 1.79 per mmBtu.
Reliance started commercial gas production from the CBM blocks in March 2017 and reached the peak of 3 mmscmd before the end of 2018.
CBM is natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95 per cent methane.
The pricing formula notified on Wednesday is a variation over the 2017 formula when Reliance had sought bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.
In that bidding for up to 3 mmscmd of gas, Reliance had outbid rivals including state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd to buy the entire volume.
Earlier this month, Reliance and its partner BP plc of UK bid out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 block by pricing the fuel at JKM (Japan Korea Marker).
The JKM represents the price for spot LNG delivered in the Asian market and is now being widely used in the LNG industry as a marker for medium/ long term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.
In that auction, bidders were asked to ""quote the variable denoted as 'V' in USD per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) terms.""

""The gas price (in USD/mmBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM + V,"" the bidding notice had said adding the 'V' could not be less than USD (-)0.30/mmBtu.
Reliance bought two-thirds of the volume in that auction.

RIL, which is undergoing the process of transferring to a wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance O2C Limited (O2C), is taking this step towards facilitating participation by strategic investors in its O2C businesses. “We anticipate the reorganisation will have a neutral impact on RIL's credit metrics and rating,” stated Fitch Ratings.
RIL will be giving a long-term interest-bearing loan of $25 billion to the new entity.

The agency also stated that it does not expect any change in RIL's consolidated adjusted net leverage, which is approaching zero amid declining capex. “We expect RIL's liquidity at the parent level to remain strong. This would be assisted further by cash upstreaming via interest and debt repayments on long-term loans from O2C in addition to potential dividends from its large subsidiaries.”
The proposed reorganisation eases the formation of strategic partnerships and stake sales to potential investors focused on investments in oil-to-chemicals businesses, stated the agency. “RIL has been in discussions with Saudi Aramco to sell a minority stake in its oil-to-chemicals businesses, which, if successful, should lead to further deleveraging of RIL,” it stated."

Reliance to spin off oil-to-chemicals business with USD 25 bn loan,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/reliance-to-spin-off-oil-to-chemicals-business-with-usd-25-bn-loan,": Tuesday, February 23, 2021, 10:09 PM IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries announced the contours of spinning-off its oil refining, fuel marketing and petrochemical (oil-to-chemical) business into an independent unit with a USD 25 billion loan from the parent, as it looks to unlock value by settling stakes to global investors like Saudi Aramco.
The carving out of Reliance O2C Limited (O2C) will enable the focused pursuit of opportunities across the oil-to-chemicals value chain, improve efficiencies through self-sustaining capital structure and a dedicated management team, and attract dedicated pools of investor capital, according to a company presentation filed with the stock exchanges.
The transfer of twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, petrochemical sites in multiple states, and a 51 per cent stake in the fuel retailing business to O2C will be on a 'slump sale basis', subject to requisite approvals that are expected to come in by September.
However, upstream oil and gas producing fields such as KG-D6 and textiles business will not form part of the new unit, where it aims to maintain a significant majority stake.
The consideration for the transfer will be in the form of long-term interest-bearing debt of USD 25 billion to be issued by O2C to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). RIL's external debt is proposed to remain with RIL only.
Once completed, RIL -- the company founded by Dhirubhai Ambani in the late 1960s -- will house only the upstream oil and gas exploration and production business, financial services, group treasury and legacy textile businesses, and act as a holding company of the group.
The retail business is held in Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd and telecom and digital ventures are nested in Jio Platforms Ltd.
Long-dated loans issued by O2C to RIL, as part of the reorganisation, will provide an efficient mechanism to upstream cash generated from O2C to RIL, the presentation said.
RIL has been in ongoing discussions with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) to sell a minority 20 per cent stake in its O2C businesses, which, if successful, should lead to further deleveraging of the company.
While Moody's Investors Service said the separation of O2C business ""will facilitate a potential stake sale to Aramco, possibly enabling a further reduction in RIL's net debt,"" Fitch Ratings said the reorganisation ""will have a neutral impact on RIL's credit metrics and rating."" The wholly-owned O2C unit's assets will be funded by the interest-bearing loan, which will be an ""efficient mechanism to upstream cash, including any potential capital receipts,"" in the unit, RIL said.
RIL will provide a loan of USD 25 billion to the O2C subsidiary at floating interest rate with the subsidiary having about USD 42 billion of assets (28 per cent of consolidated assets). Even though the O2C assets will move into a new arm, its debt will continue to sit inside RIL.
In August 2019, RIL had agreed to upstream Rs 1.08 lakh crore of Jio's debt to make its telecom venture debt-free, ahead of inducting strategic and financial investors like Facebook, Google and KKR.
RIL sold a 33 per cent stake in the digital services to global investors including Facebook and Google for Rs 1.52 lakh crore and 10 per cent in its retail subsidiary to global investors for Rs 47,265 crore.
Also, aiding the net debt-free status was proceeds from RIL's Rs 51,124 crore rights issue.
RIL holds 85.1 per cent of Reliance Retail and 67.3 per cent of Jio Platforms.
As of December 2020, RIL's gross debt stood at Rs 2.57 lakh crore.
RIL is also working on a structure wherein the interest cost that the O2C arm will bear for buying the assets will be equal to the interest cost that parent RIL bears for its outstanding loans.
""Reorganisation of O2C business facilitates participation by strategic investors and marquee sector-focused investors,"" the firm said, adding it would have no impact on RIL's consolidated financials as well as investment-grade international and domestic credit ratings.
RIL also announced its aim to work with the O2C business to reduce its carbon footprint and become ""net carbon zero"" by 2035.
Its vision includes investing in developing renewable energy systems to meet energy demand and to speed up the transition from traditional carbon-based fuels to hydrogen.
Reliance O2C Limited houses oil refining and petrochemical plants and manufacturing assets, bulk and wholesale fuel marketing, and RIL's 51 per cent interest in retail fuel joint venture with BP of the UK.
The O2C unit also houses the firm's Singapore and the UK-based oil trading subsidiaries and marketing subsidiary, Reliance Industries Uruguay Petroquimica SA.
It also houses Reliance Ethane Pipeline Limited that operates a pipeline between Dahej in Gujarat and Nagothane in Maharashtra as well as a 74.9 per cent stake that Reliance holds in the joint venture with Sibur.
Its very large ethane carriers, gas pipelines such as one that transports coal-bed methane from its CBM blocks, overseas oil and gas asset holding company Reliance Industries (Middle East) DMCC, and domestic exploration and production assets would not form part of the O2C unit.
Also, RIL's textiles business as operated out of the Naroda site, Baroda township and land, including cricket stadium, Jamnagar power assets, and Sikka Ports and Terminals Limited would also not be part of the O2C unit.
RIL owns and operates twin oil refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.
It is also the country's largest petrochemical manufacturer with units at Jamnagar, Dahej, Hazira, Nagothane, Vadodara, Patalganga, Silvassa, Barabanki, and Hoshiarpur.
The company holds a 66.6 per cent stake in the KG-D6 block where it is investing about USD 5 billion in developing a second set of gas discoveries along with BP.
It also has a similar stake in the NEC-25 block in the Bay of Bengal and operates two CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh. These upstream assets are not part of the O2C unit."

Following the development, investors cheered RIL on Tuesday's trading session to an extent that the stock was among top performers.

In a presentation filed at exchanges, the company stated that RIL's unprecedented growth in the last decade has been driven by significant growth in O2C Business and rapid scale-up of new consumer businesses - Digital and Retail.

While providing the rationale for O2C business reorganization, RIL said that an independent growth company enables the focused pursuit of opportunities across the O2C value chain. Further, the independent business will enhance efficiencies through a self-sustaining capital structure and dedicated management team. Also, it will facilitate value creation through strategic partnerships and attract dedicated pools of investor capital.

RIL stakeholders will also be beneficial from this reorganization. RIL will hold 100% management control of the new subsidiary. Also, the existing  O2C operating team moves with the transfer of business. Further, there is no dilution of earnings or any restriction on cash flows.

There will be no change in the shareholding pattern of RIL in O2C re-organization. RIL will maintain its shareholding of 49.14% in Reliance O2C Limited.

Under the 100% O2C subsidiary, RIL will transfer refining, marketing and petrochemicals assets. Notably, the fuel retail subsidiary will also be part of the proposed O2C Business, under which, RIL holds a 51% stake and the remaining 49% stake is held by BP Plc.

RIL has already bagged Sebi and stock exchanges approval for the business re-organization. The deal now seeks approval from equity shareholders and creditors, regulatory authorities, income tax authority, NCLT Mumbai and NCLT Ahmedabad.

Furthermore, RIL has announced an interest-bearing loan of $25B to the O2C business. O2C to pay floating rate interest linked to 1-year SBI MCLR rate. RIL said, ""Consideration for O2C assets funded by an interest-bearing loan from RIL to O2C – efficient mechanism to upstream cash, including any potential capital receipts in O2C.""

RIL expects the consent process to be completed by Q1FY22, however, approval from NCLT Mumbai and NCLT Ahmedabad is expected by Q2 FY22.

RIL is expected to retain its investment-grade international (BBB+/ Baa2), and domestic AAA credit ratings.

At around 11.18 am, RIL traded near the day's high to Rs2051 per piece surging by Rs43.45 or 2.17%.  The stock has touched an intraday high of Rs2053.10 per piece in early deals.

At the current market price, RIL's market capitalisation skyrocketed to Rs13 lakh cr. "
Reliance Jio to infuse $200 million in venture capital fund Kalaari Capital,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/reliance-jio-to-infuse-usd-200-million-in-venture-capital-fund-kalaari-capital/story/432106.html,"BusinessToday.In | February 23, 2021 | Updated 16:15 IST","Reliance's Jio Platforms is reportedly planning to invest up to $200 million in the domestic venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. So far Jio has closed a $100 million infusion and an additional commitment of $100 million is slated for later, The Economic Times reported.
ADVERTISING
The Bengaluru-based venture capitalist firm came into prominence in the past decade after the venture capital fund backed a string of startups like--Snapdeal, Myntra, Uran Ladder, and Dream11. With RIL's Jio Platforms fund infusion into Kalaari, the deal will emerge as one of the largest commitments by an Indian conglomerate in a venture capital firm.
RIL's backing has come after some of Kalaari's portfolio firms, like Urban Ladder and Zivame, were acquired by units of Reliance Industries.
Kalaari has been in the market to raise its fourth fund for over a few years. In January 2019, Vani Kola had said that the fund was targeting $200 million but no further announcements were made. Kalaari had last raised a fund in 2015 when it mopped $290 million.
Kalaari was set up in 2006 when technology entrepreneur Kola, former Intel Corp Vice President Vinod Dham, and former Intel executive Kumar Shiralagi launched a $190-million India fund backed by Silicon Valley venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates (NEA).
Originally, Kalaari Capital was called NEA IndoUS Venture Partners, which became IndoUS Venture Partners when NEA decided to go solo in India. However, with Dham leaving in 2012, the fund was renamed as Kalaari.

Here are some highlights from analyst reports…
Morgan Stanley
The demerger plan for oil-to-chemicals business is a step towards monetisation and acceleration of RIL’s new energy and material plans into batteries, hydrogen, renewables and carbon capture.
RIL is embarking on its journey to address the $800 billion in organised retail and e-commerce, $300 billion in chemicals, and $50 billion in new energy (renewables) as demand shifts from oil to alternative fuels.
RIL will have four growth engines post reorganisation — digital, retail, new materials, and new energy.
Do not see the reorganisation impacting consolidated financials.
Talks have restarted on a potential stake sale in RIL’s O2C business to Saudi Aramco. Valuations/asset prices are expected to rebound to levels seen in August 2019 with a much-improved industry outlook.
Kotak Securities
The proposed O2C reorganisation may facilitate participation by strategic as well as financial investors.
The O2C entity will focus on carbon capture and hydrogen production technologies.
The O2C entity will be able to efficiently upstream cash through dividends, interest, and debt repayment, which may include any receipts from strategic investment in the O2C business.
The reorganisation will be tax neutral for RIL and it will not impact consolidated cash flows. It will help RIL to retain its credit ratings.
RIL will retain new energy and new materials businesses with a focus to develop green energy ecosystem and adopt new technologies to reduce carbon footprint."

The company said the O2C business will be turned into a separate entity that will be 100 per cent owned by RIL and will result in no change in the company's shareholding.

But analysts believe that this restructuring will trigger the next leg of up move in the stock and pave way for the Saudi Aramco deal that the oil-to-telecom behemoth had announced in August 2019. According to media reports, the talks have restarted on that front.
“Key benefit from the deal is that reorganization of O2C would ease out its stake sale into the unit to strategic investors like Saudi Aramco and others. In line with Reliance Retail Ventures and Jio Platform stake sale, we expect it to pare 20-25 per cent stake to strategic investors, which would unlock huge value to its shareholders,” said a note by IDBI Capital.

Jio | Kalaari Capital: Jio Platforms set to invest $200 million in Kalaari Capital,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/scoop-jio-platforms-set-to-invest-200-million-in-kalaari-capital/articleshow/81162505.cms,"Last Updated: Feb 23, 2021, 09:13 AM IST","Mumbai | Bengaluru: Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 %’ Jio Platforms is finalising an investment of up to $200 million in domestic venture capital fund Kalaari Capital, according to two people in the know of the matter.

The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate has closed a $100-million infusion, with an additional commitment of $100 million slated for later, said another person aware of the group's plans to deepen its footprint in India’s burgeoning technology sector.

“Kalaari Capital has communicated to multiple venture funds about racking up $100 million from Reliance, with the rest of the capital…to come in over the next year,” said one of the persons cited above, who did not want to be identified as the talks are private.

Vani Kola-led Kalaari Capital will look to raise the second tranche over the next 12-18 months from either Reliance or external sponsors, a source privy to the development told ET. The venture capital firm gained prominence in the past decade by backing a string of e-commerce startups—including Snapdeal, Urban Ladder and Myntra—as well as unicorns such as online gaming platform Dream11.

With Reliance backing Kalaari as its anchor investor or limited partner, the deal will emerge as one of the largest commitments by an Indian conglomerate in a venture capital firm.

In an emailed response to ET, a Reliance spokesperson said, “Reliance remains committed to supporting the build-up of a thriving startup ecosystem in India, particularly in digital enablement space, and will continue to explore various avenues to do so.”

Kalaari Capital did not respond to ET’s query till press time on Monday.

Bengaluru-based Kalaari has been in the market to raise its fourth fund for over a few years. In January 2019, Kola told ET in an interview that the fund was targeting $200 million, but there was no subsequent announcement on fund closure.

Notably, the VC firm had last raised a fund in 2015, when it mopped up $290 million—its largest corpus—in the backdrop of a funding frenzy in the Indian startup ecosystem.

Reliance’s backing comes after some of Kalaari’s portfolio companies—including furniture retailer Urban Ladder and lingerie retailer Zivame—were acquired by units of Reliance Industries.

Eye on the future

“Reliance’s investment in Kalaari will give the company an early line of sight into startups and upcoming sectors,” said one person aware of the deal. “RIL won’t necessarily acquire all the companies in which Kalaari invests, but it will certainly act as a discovery pipeline.”

Reliance will use a two-pronged approach to take over companies that fill gaps in its capabilities, while keeping an eye on potential areas of future growth through Kalaari, said another person, requesting anonymity.

Startup entrepreneurs are of the view that it is not a secret that Kalaari has grown close to Reliance Industries in recent years. “I don’t think entrepreneurs will perceive RIL’s backing as a bad thing, but Vani does have a troubled history with some of the founders of her portfolio companies, which may be an issue,” said one entrepreneur on the condition of anonymity.


A veteran investor, Kola is known for spotting startups operating in the consumer internet space, but for the past few years, has battled top-level churn as well as disagreements and fallouts with portfolio firms and founders.

ET reported in January that Kalaari’s stake sale in hyperlocal grocery provider MilkBasket to Mahendra Nahata’s MN Televentures had foiled the startup’s plan to raise capital or explore an acquisition by any suitor apart from Reliance. Nahata is known to be an associate of Ambani and Reliance.

Kalaari, in its original avatar, was set up in 2006 when technology entrepreneur Kola, former Intel Corp Vice President Vinod Dham and former Intel executive Kumar Shiralagi launched a $190-million India fund backed by Silicon Valley venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates (NEA).

At the time, it was called NEA IndoUS Venture Partners, which became IndoUS Venture Partners when NEA decided to go solo in India after a few years. However, the final reordering happened in 2012, with Dham leaving and the fund being renamed Kalaari."

In the third quarter of the current fiscal, the company reported refining and petrochemical as well as fuel retailing businesses earnings as one.
RIL had started working on hiving off the O2C business into a separate unit last year for a possible stake sale to companies such as Saudi Aramco. Reliance Industries has the country’s largest petrochemical manufacturer with units at Jamnagar, Dahej, Hazira, Nagothane, Vadodara, Patalganga, Silvassa, Barabanki, and Hoshiarpur.

Asian stocks dipped on Tuesday as rising US Treasury yields and inflation prospects led to a further rotation out of the big tech stocks responsible for a major Wall Street rally during the pandemic.
Oil prices rose on tight global supply outlook after US production was hammered by frigid weather and an approaching meeting of top crude producers which will likely to see output being kept largely in check.
Bond yields have risen sharply this month as prospects of more US fiscal stimulus have boosted hopes for a faster economic recovery globally. However, that has also fuelled inflation expectations, prompting investors to sell growth stocks that drove the equity rally during the pandemic.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.18% on Monday, slipping from a record top last week as the jump in US bond yields unsettled investors.
Commodity prices rose partly as the US dollar remained broadly weak. The dollar index fell 0.287%, with the euro up 0.09% to $1.2165. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.06% versus the greenback at 104.99 per dollar.

The Mukesh Ambani-led company said it is looking at completing the process by FY22.
The Supreme Court on Monday restrained the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) from approving the ₹24,713-crore deal between Kishore Biyani’s Future Retail Ltd (FRL) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), after Amazon.com Inc. filed a plea before the apex court.

In a presentation to investors, the Mukesh Ambani-led company stated, it is looking at completing the process by FY 2022.
The presentation stated, “Consent process to be completed by Q1FY22, NCLT approval expected by Q2FY22.” The company expects to receive orders from NCLT Mumbai and NCLT Ahmedabad by the second quarter of FY 2022, after meeting with creditors and shareholders in the first quarter of FY 2022.

(Bloomberg) -- India’s Supreme Court stopped regulatory approval for the Future Group’s $3.4 billion asset sale to Reliance Industries Ltd., delaying the deal in a boost for Amazon.com Inc., which wants to scuttle the transaction in its bid to dominate the country’s retail sector.
Agreeing with the American e-commerce giant’s petition, the top court on Monday overturned a lower court’s ruling and said the National Company Law Tribunal can continue hearing the case but must not give a final nod till further orders. The court also sought written statements from Future Retail Ltd. and said it will hear the case after three weeks. Future’s stocks and bonds fell.
”In the meantime, the NCLT proceedings will be allowed to go on but will not culminate in any final order of sanction of scheme,” according to the order posted on the court’s website.
The latest verdict restores the legal advantage for Jeff Bezos-founded Amazon that secured an interim stay on the deal from a Singapore arbitration tribunal in October. It accused the Future Group of violating a partnership contract when it agreed to sell assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate last year. The Monday order, however, endangers Future Retail, which is struggling to pay debt and has warned of insolvency.

Why Amazon Is Feuding With a Retailer Ambani Wants to Buy: Q&A
Future Retail’s stock fell as much as 10% and its dollar bond maturing in 2025 dropped 3.8 cents on the dollar after the court order Monday, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. Reliance Industries also slipped as much as 2.8%.
Representatives for Amazon India, Future and Reliance Industries didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Future Retail can move the Singapore arbitration tribunal to lift the interim stay the emergency arbitrator had imposed, that has formed the basis of Indian Supreme Court’s order.
The cash strapped Indian retailer, which says it would collapse should the deal with Reliance fail, is caught between two of the world’s richest men as they compete for dominance in India’s estimated $1 trillion consumer retail market. The legal dispute over Future has turned into a fierce legal wrangle across courtrooms in two countries. Amazon is unwilling to cede any competitive advantage to Reliance in the only billion-people-plus market left in the world after the American firm lost out to local rivals in China.
The case is also keenly watched by investors as it sets a precedent on the validity of emergency decisions by foreign arbitrators in India. The verdict comes at a time when Amazon is increasing its footprint in the country. The U.S. firm announced this month that it was setting up manufacturing operations in the South Asian country.

Stock Market News
2021-02-23 07:56","By Aditya Raghunath
Investing.com -- Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) (NS: RELI ), the bellwether of Indian stock exchanges, are trading up 1.46% on news that the company is spinning off its O2C (oil to chemicals) business as a 100% subsidiary.
RIL will retain 100% management control of the subsidiary. RIL said that the promoters will continue to hold a 49.14% stake in the O2C and there will be no change in the shareholding of the company.
This move comes as the company is in talks with Saudi Arabia’s Saudi Aramco (SE: 2222 ), the world’s largest crude oil exporter, to structure a deal where it might pick up around a 20% stake in RIL’s O2C business. In a filing to the exchanges, RIL said, “Reorganisation of O2C business facilitates participation by strategic investors and marquee sector-focused investors.”This statement is a clear nod to the Aramco deal.
All of its refining, marketing, and petrochemical assets will be transferred to the O2C subsidiary.
A report by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) said that the spinoff will accelerate the monetization of the assets, and help the company focus on new energy and the renewables space. “We do not see the reorganization impacting consolidated financials,” Morgan Stanley said in its report.
RIL is currently trading at Rs 2,037. The stock has seen turbulence in recent months. It went from Rs 2,324 in September 2020 to Rs 1,841 in January 2021."

Weak global cues, rising bond yields, amid fears of Covid-19-led lockdown came to haunt the bulls on the Street. Meanwhile, elevated oil prices and stretched valuations also concerned investors as most chose to take the profit off the table and stay on the sidelines following a secular rally in the benchmark in nearly one year.
The BSE barometer Sensex plunged 1,145 points or 2.25 per cent to give up the 50,000 mark and ended at 49,744. Its NSE counterpart Nifty slipped 306 points or 2.04 per cent to 14,676.
With this, both the indices have shed over 4 per cent in the five days.
Index heavyweights, Reliance Industries, HDFC, TCS, ICICI Bank and Infosys were among the top Sensex drags. At the same time, ONGC was the best performer, up over 1 per cent.
India VIX, however, spiked 14.47 per cent to 25.47 ahead of the monthly expiry on Thursday.
Investors on BSE became poorer by Rs 4.09 trillion as the market cap of the listed firms on BSE crashed to Rs 199.96 trillion.
Here are the top factors behind the market crash:
- Weak global cues
Indices back home fell tracking mixed cues from global peers. Asian shares turned mixed as expectations for faster economic growth and inflation globally battered bonds and boosted commodities while rising real yields made equity valuations look more stretched in comparison.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went flat while Japan's Nikkei recouped 0.8 per cent and South Korea 0.1 per cent, but Chinese blue chips lost 1.4 per cent. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1 per cent and EUROSTOXX 50 futures 0.3 per cent, while FTSE futures fell 0.7 per cent, indicating a weak start for European and US markets later today.
- Rising bond yields
A jump in bond yields both in India and in the US unsettled investors on Dalal Street. The government bond yields jumped to their highest level since August 27 while yields on 10-year Treasury notes have already reached 1.38 per cent, breaking the psychological 1.30 per cent level and bringing the rise for the year so far to a steep 43 basis points, reported Reuters.
""For an investor, it is imperative to know that rising bond yields are huge determinants of equity valuations. The taper tantrum of 2013 is one example that showed the relation between the two wherein a sudden rise in bond yields caused markets to slide as mass bond selling was witnessed. Bond yields are inversely proportional to equity returns and when bond yields decline, equity markets tend to outperform while when yields rise equity market returns tend to falter,"" explained Nirali Shah, head of equity research at Samco Securities.
- Spike in Covid cases
According to the Union Health Ministry, India reported an increase in active cases for the fifth day in a row. The total tally of Covid-19 infections surpassed 1.10 crore with 14,199 new infections being reported in a day, as per the data available on February 22.
Meanwhile Maharashtra, the state worst hit by the pandemic, is once again seeing a dramatic surge in the rate of infections with Pune district alone reporting over 1,000 fresh cases on Sunday. Following this, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackery's government banned political, religious and social gatherings and imposed a new lockdown in some areas. Going ahead, market participants will track the development in Covid cases and new lockdowns could temper market sentiment.
- Oil on a boil
The recent heating up of oil prices is another factor that is concerning investors back home as crude forms a major part of India's import and could have a bearing on the rupee and increase raw material costs for firms. Oil prices today rose as the slow return of US crude output cut by frigid conditions raised concerns about supply, just as demand recovers from the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. Brent crude was up 76 cents, or 1.2 per cent at $61.67 a barrel after gaining nearly 1 per cent last week. The US oil rose 74 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $59.98 a barrel, having fallen 0.4% last week.
- Valuation concerns
Analysts on Dalal Street also blamed valuations behind the correction in the market.
""The markets had rallied a lot, so some amount of profit booking is happening in the market. The falls have accelerated over the past few days in the run-up to the F&O expiry on Thursday. Meanwhile, valuations have been expensive, having predominantly driven by flows, and are on the higher side,"" said Jyoti Roy, deputy vice-president at Angel Broking.
Meanwhile, G Chokkalingam of Equinomics Research believes that 90 per cent of the crash in the market is due to valuation concerns. ""It is good to see this correction because if you don't have such periodic corrections, you will have a massive crash in the market,"" he added.
- F&O expiry
Given the near-term headwinds, investors also rushed to book profit ahead of the expiry of futures & options (F&O) contracts for the February series due this Thursday.
""On Friday, Nifty Call options for both weekly and monthly contracts saw highest open interest (OI) at 16,000 with highest OI added at 15,000. In Puts, 14500 was the highest OI strike in weekly with highest addition at 14200, and in monthly, 14000 strike had highest Put OI with highest addition at 14800,"" said a morning note from Geojit Financial Services."

There is no pressing need to deleverage, unlike 18 months ago when Aramco deal was first announced In 2020, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) set deal street on fire with large stake sales in its telecom and retail businesses and a rights issue. A news report now suggests that fundraising and deleveraging will continue in 2021, through a deal in the oil-to-chemicals business (O2C). The Economic Times reported that RIL’s talks with Saudi Aramco for a stake sale in its refining and petrochemcials business are back on track. The deal has been in the works for around two years now, and was the first mega deal announced to shed weight in the RIL balance sheet. In August 2019, RIL had announced plans to sell a 20% stake to Aramco in the O2C business at an enterprise value of $75 billion. However, reports later suggested that there were differences on valuation, with the pandemic driving down profits and valuations of businesses the world over.

Now that the company has raised around $33 billion ( ₹2.5 trillion) in the past year, the need to deleverage is hardly a motivation for RIL. As such, it is likely to stick to its high valuation expectations, though profits of the O2C business have declined because of the pandemic.
For Aramco, on the other hand, paying a premium for a strategic stake may still make sense.
The Saudi state-owned oil company has been increasing its footprint in downstream businesses, buying stakes and entering into joint ventures in large companies in countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, and China. A stake in RIL will give it access to a huge Indian market and technologically advanced RIL assets. While there is a move globally towards electric vehicles, with the need for crude gradually expected to reduce, this trend is expected to play out slowly in India.
As such, it makes sense for Aramco to have a strategic presence in the country, said analysts.
Meanwhile, the oil to chemical business has been rebounding well for RIL. There are limited refinery expansions in the country, and this is positive for Reliance Industries’s refining business. If it gets a premium based on all of these factors, it will help re-rate the stock.

RIL’s relative valuation vis-a-vis global peers has returned to long-term averages, a first since its asset monetization, analysts at Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd said in a recent note to clients.
The significant recovery seen in forward refining spreads, above mid-cycle chemical margins, and the upside in consumer retail could see consensus earnings rise from the trough, they said.
On the flip side, growth in the telecom business has turned sluggish and analysts expect the company to increase its spectrum holdings in the upcoming auctions to improve growth.

Credit Suisse said in its report today,""We initiate coverage on NMDC with an OUTPERFORM rating and a target price of Rs162.00 (45% upside). We expect NMDC to maintain elevated EBITDA in coming years, driven by (i) enhanced ASPs, as we expect Indian ore supply to remain tight and global ore price to remain at US$100/t+ until FY23E; (ii) higher volumes as it breaks out from the 35mt range, which has lasted many years, on better visibility on Donimalai resumption (7mt); and (iii) improving pricing power as its customer base is much more fragmented than earlier (HHI 1807 from 3218 in FY16). With the steel plant demerger in sight, unlocking of Rs160 bn capital work-in-progress (CWIP) could add further value to the stock.""
1.12PM: Nestle India Q3FY21 Results Review
HDFC Securities said in its report today,"" Nestle's 4QCY20 revenue growth was largely in line with beat in gross margin. High employee cost (long-term compensation arrangements to factory employees) impacted the margin (miss in EBITDA). Domestic revenue grew by 10% YoY while exports were down by 8% YoY. Thereby, overall revenue growth of 9% was slightly below estimates (HSIE 11%). Packaged food category continued to perform well, and Nestle's performance in CY20 was steady (8% YoY growth). Maggi, Kitkat and Nescafe (in-home consumption) posted double-digit growth during the year, capitalising on the reduced mobility among consumers. However, weak coffee exports impacted overall exports (-8% in 4Q and +1% in CY20). GM expanded by robust 231bps YoY to 59%, the highest in the past eight quarters. EBITDA grew by 10.4% as compared to our expectation of 17% growth; the key difference was due to high employee cost (25% up YoY).
It added,"" We expect Nestle to deliver steady earnings growth, aided by new launches and improved distribution. Moderation in in-home consumption categories will impact key brands but revival in OOH will support growth. We maintain our EPS estimate for CY21E/CY22E. We value Nestle at 55x P/E on CY22E EPS to derive a TP of Rs 16,326. The stock is trading at 58x P/E on CY22E EPS and limits absolute upside in the medium term, making the risk-reward unattractive. Maintain REDUCE.""

Moreover JMC projects in which the company owns a 67% stake has an order backlog of Rs. 14,203 crore at the end of Q3FY21, which provides strong revenue visibility. Sale of Transmission Asset, merger of KPTL and JMC projects, strategic stake divestment in Logistic business will result in a significant deleveraging of the balance sheet over the next few quarters. Management guidance for pledge reduction by Dec'21 is also positive and will lead to a significant rerating for the company. We have a BUY rating on the company with a target price of Rs. 425.""
12. 30 PM: Adani Ports share hits new high on Dighi port acquisition

Adani Ports share hits new high on Dighi port acquisition
12. 17 PM: Telecom sector outlook
JM Financial said in its note today,"" 3QFY21 witnessed continued leadership of Bharti Airtel in subscriber additions for the second quarter in a row, continued moderation in subscriber additions for Jio and moderation in subscriber losses for VIL. This, in our view, presents a conundrum for the industry, as Jio could delay tariff hikes to increase the subscriber addition momentum, as it has a stated target of 500mn subscribers within the next 3 years. While VIL has reiterated that it would not shy away from a tariff hike, it was waiting for the 'right' time - which we think could indicate continued stability in its subscriber base, while Bharti had reiterated that they would not raise tariffs unless the industry as a whole raises tariffs. Consequently the impending Jiophone and low-cost smartphone launch, and its success in increasing Jio's subscriber addition momentum would be the catalyst for an industry-wide tariff hike.""
11. 56 AM: Indraprastha Gas Q3 outlook
Geojit Financial Services said in its note today,"" Revenue declined 13.2% YoY in Q2FY21 due to lower volumes (-6.5% YoY).CNG volumes down by 9.1% YoY but PNG volumes remains flat. EBITDA margin increased significantly to 10.1pps YoY benefitted by lower natural gas purchase costs and improved volumes partially offset by higher other expenses.Resultantly PAT increased by 18.0% YoY. Improved capacity utilization, easing of COVID restrictions and institutions reopening will support the company's operational and financial performance in the near future. Hence, we reiterate BUY rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs. 630 based on SOTP methodology.""
11. 47 AM: Ujjivan SFB Outlook and Valuation
LKP Securities said in its note today,""Although asset quality deterioration was a negative surprise, we believe management has taken the right step in fast tracking provisions for the stress book, ensuring focus returns to growth in FY22-23E. We believe the company will benefit from lower credit costs and higher growth in FY22-23E due to the clean-up initiated in the quarter. We recommend BUY with target price of ?48, implying a valuation of 2.1x FY23E P/ABV.""
11. 30 AM: Gold international & domestic outlook
Kshitij Purohit, Product Manager, Currency & Commodities, CapitalVia Global Research said,"" International Gold and Silver prices are trading with marginal gains since morning supported by the hopes of quick economy recovery and weak U.S. Dollar.

Jyoti Roy - DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking said,"" LIC Housing finance is one of India's largest housing finance companies with a loan book of over Rs. 2.1lakh crore at the end of Q3FY21 with a strong presence across all geographies. Stress on the developers loan book which accounts for ~`7% of the company's loan book had led to a de-rating of the stocks as it has raised concerns over asset quality issues. The management has highlighted that 2-3 large developer books will get resolved in Q4FY21. The company has posted a good set of numbers for Q3FY21 as individual home disbursements as up by 30.7% YoY. Incremental cost of funding for the company stood at 5.25% for the quarter which should lead to improvement in spreads going forward.  Management commentary was also positive on the asset quality front as they do not expect an increase in NPA by more than 1% while restructuring should not exceed 1% of the book. Strong growth in disbursements along with lowers than expected stress on asset quality should lead to further rerating for the company. We have a BUY rating on LIC Housing Finance with a target price of Rs. 570.""

Sameet Chavan (Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking) said,""Monday's strong close coupled with favourable global cues in the morning, our markets managed to carry their momentum at the opening yesterday. However, since we reached a crucial resistance zone of 15380 - 15500 (which is the 161% 'Golden Ratio' of the entire fall from Jan'20 highs to March'20 lows), markets saw some profit booking at higher levels. We were not surprised with it as we had advocated on booking profits in the mentioned range. With yesterday's small correction, still there is no weakness visible on charts; but we continue to remain cautious and advise against creating aggressive longs now. For the coming session, 15380 - 15430 remains to be a key resistance; whereas on the lower side, further weakness is possible after breaking below 15240. In this scenario, 15175 - 15100 can be retested.

Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.,"" An important development yesterday was the US 10-year bond yield touching 1.29%, the highest level since Feb 2020. The bond market is factoring in a rise in inflation in the coming months. The rise in yield reflects the market's concern that President Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package on top of the massive monetary stimulus will lead to a spike in inflation. If the yields continue to rise, it can be negative for equity markets. It may be too early to take an investment call based on this. But, this space has to be watched.

According to documents submitted to the emergency arbitrator of SIAC by the Kishore Biyani-led firm, Amazon had asked for USD 40 million in compensation from Future Group for the deal with Reliance Industries, and that the US-based company was well aware of the Rs 24,713 crore Future-RIL deal.
However, an Amazon spokesperson said the company denies the ""false and misleading claims being made by the Future Group on a purported request for compensation to forego the right of first refusal"".

""This is a questionable and an ill-timed attempt to mislead the public at large more particularly when Amazon has filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court. Amazon has consistently offered to assist FRL during the economic downturn caused by COVID and reiterated our openness for a dialogue even during the Delhi High Court hearings, which was declined by Future Group,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.
On August 29, 2020, Future Group had announced that its retail and wholesale business would be sold to Reliance Retail, owned by oil-to-chemical conglomerate RIL in a Rs 24,713 crore deal.
In October 2020, Amazon dragged Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.
Future Group, in its submission to SIAC in October last year, stated: ""In August 2020, two phone calls among the 3rd respondent (Kishore Biyani) and 8th respondent (Rakesh Biyani) and Abhijit Mujumdar on behalf of the claimant (Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC), the claimant asked for USD 40 million as compensation in exchange for the Future Group and Reliance proceedings with the disputed transaction"".
""The claimant's contention in the NOA and the application that it did not have any information in connection with the disputed transaction is incorrect,"" the document - a copy of which was seen by PTI - said.
The document - dated October 12, 2020 - also noted Future Retail had made a public announcement on August 29, 2020, about the deal ""after having informed the claimant's representatives that discussions were ongoing with Reliance"".
""So, leaving aside the messages, calls and e-mails referred, the claimant was aware of the disputed transaction for more than a month before it initiated the present arbitration proceedings,"" Future said in its submission, a copy of which was seen by PTI.
On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
Even after the interim award, Amazon and Future Group remain locked in a legal tussle in the matter. Both parties have approached several legal forums.
On the other hand, the Future-Reliance deal has already received clearance from CCI, SEBI and bourses, and the scheme of arrangement is now awaiting the nod from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and shareholders."

Mutual funds reduce stake in key Nifty stocks in January,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/mutual-funds-reduce-stake-in-key-nifty-stocks-in-january-101613172715373.html,"UPDATED ON FEB 13, 2021 05:04 AM IST","Indian mutual funds (MFs) cut their holdings in Nifty stocks in January, as retail investors continued to withdraw money from equity schemes with indices setting new records.
In January, local MFs trimmed their positions in Reliance Industries Ltd, Infosys Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd, PowerGrid Corp. of India and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, according to data sourced from Edelweiss Alternative Research and ACE MF.
Data showed Reliance was the most-sold stock by MFs in the month with an outflow of ₹2,081 crore. Shares of Reliance fell 7.22% in January. Currently, it has 23 buy, seven hold and five sell ratings by analysts on Bloomberg.
Despite the sell-off by equity funds in January, RIL remains one of the top 10 holdings by almost all mutual fund houses.
“Most fund houses have rejigged or rebalanced their portfolio, which is why they have cut shareholdings in Nifty major heavyweights. Typically, fund houses have high exposure to index stocks and, hence, the sell-off in these companies in a month do not necessarily reduce their holdings by a big margin,” said Abhilash Pagaria, an analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
Other top stocks that were sold by MFs in January include Infosys ( ₹2,011 crore), Bharti Airtel ( ₹1,203 crore), PowerGrid ( ₹1,031 crore) and TCS ( ₹986 crore). Domestic MFs were net sellers in Bharti Airtel while foreign institutional investors raised their stakes in telecom stocks. Data shows telecom stocks received $355 million in January from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
“It’s quite possible that the MSCI-benchmarked active funds and other FPIs could have accumulated key telecom stock Bharti Airtel. The company in January finally received 100% FII approval. The FIIs will further add Bharti Airtel (fresh flows of $700 million) in February because MSCI has increased the weight of the stock,” said Pagaria. The Bharti Airtel stock has risen 8.6% in January. Currently, it has 30 buy, two hold and zero sell ratings by analysts on Bloomberg.
Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), with an inflow of ₹927 crore, was the most bought stock. Other top stocks that MFs bought in January were HCL Technologies, Axis Bank, Asian Paints and Larsen and Toubro. The funds also bought initial public offerings (IPOs) worth ₹1,200 crore. Out of the new issues, IRFC got the major chunk followed by Indigo Paints, which got ₹140 crore, and Home First, which received ₹120 crore.

Among stocks, Reliance Industries (RIL), Infosys, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are some of the stocks mutual funds cashed out of, a recent report by Edelweiss Securities said.
The selling in the shares comes on the back of a strong rebound in these stocks since March 2020 low. However, in January 2021 shares of most of these firms put up a weak show wherein RIL shed the most, down 7 per cent followed by Power Grid that dipped nearly 3 per cent and Infosys that lost only 1 per cent. During the same period, NSE barometer Nifty dropped 2.5 per cent, ACE Equity data show.
Shares of Tata Consultancy Services and Airtel, however, added over 8 per cent each.
While mutual funds were net sellers in telecom major Bharti Airtel, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) increased their stake in the Sunil Mittal-controlled firm in the same month. FIIs will further add Bharti Airtel in their portfolio, resulting in fresh flows of $700 million in the firm in February due to MSCI increasing weight in the stock, reports say.
""Bharti Airtel continues to report resilient numbers, especially on Indian wireless business front. We see the favourable industry structure of three players (two being strong), a good enough kicker for an eventual hike in tariff as well as superior digital play in medium to long term. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a revised DCF based target price of Rs 730,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note post Airtel's Q3 numbers.

While Axis Bank and L&T have posted a strong performance last month, logging gains of 6 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, Asian Paints and HCL Tech shares have fallen up to 12 per cent.
According to the publically available Reuters data, a consensus estimate of 33 analysts has a BUY call on L&T. Analysts believe its strong order book and government focus of Atmanirbhar Bharat along with the Capex plan bode well for the stock."

“Indian benchmark equity indices closed higher on February 11 after consolidating in the previous two sessions. Trading was light in Asia on Thursday, with most major markets closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. European stock markets were marginally higher Thursday, with investors looking to take their cues from the corporate sector on another busy earnings day. Nifty rose mildly on Feb 11 after a sideways move on the previous two sessions. It could remain in the 15064-15257 band in the near term and a breakout either side could see action in that direction.”
Ajit Mishra, VP – Research, Religare Broking –
“Markets ended with modest gains in a volatile trading session. After the initial downtick,  the benchmark recovered in no time and remained range-bound thereafter. We reiterate our bullish view on markets however traders should maintain extra caution in the selection of stocks now. Participants would be actively tracking key macroeconomic data like IIP, CPI and WPI data for cues on Friday. A decisive break above 15,250 would trigger further up move else consolidation will continue.”
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services-
“The domestic market closed with slight gains after its range-bound rally, tracking gains in index heavyweights and positive European & Asian markets. The upward movement in the market was supported by energy, telecom and FMCG stocks with small caps outperforming. Dip in January auto retail sales numbers pushed the sectoral index into the negative territory while PSU banks also remained under pressure.”
Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities –
“Index closed a day on a positive note at 15173 with gains of half a per cent, the index has formed a range and it’s trading within the same range last four sessions. The overall range for nifty is coming at 15k on the downside and 15250 on the higher side so unless we see either side breakout final direction will not be clear and index may trade sideways in the same range.”
Manish Shah, Founder, Niftytriggers –
“Nifty closed the day with a marginal net gain. Nifty has a resistance barrier at 15,150 and Nifty has closed above this level, it could mean that more upsides will be in place. Nifty is likely to rally towards 15500-15600 in next 6-8 days. The trot seen in the last three days is a possible re-accumulation phase to use Richard Wyckoff term. Expect a steady rally in Nifty towards 15500-15600 as long as 14950 holds. The next leg of up move could be in the offing.”

Amazon appeals to Indias Supreme Court in Future deal dispute: Sources,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/amazon-appeals-to-india-s-supreme-court-in-future-deal-dispute-sources-101613014384008.html,"PUBLISHED ON FEB 11, 2021 09:25 AM IST","Amazon.com Inc has mounted a legal challenge against its partner Future Group's $3.4 billion retail assets sale in India's Supreme Court, three sources told Reuters on Thursday, marking the US firm's latest effort to block the deal.
Amazon, locked in legal disputes with Future, alleges the Indian firm violated contracts by agreeing to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries last year. Future denies any wrongdoing.
A New Delhi court this week dealt a blow to the US firm by revoking a previous court decision that effectively blocked the deal, and Amazon has filed an appeal against it in the Supreme Court in the capital city, the three sources said.
Amazon and Future did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The legal fight over Future's assets has embroiled two of the world's richest men - Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani. The final outcome is seen shaping India's pandemic-hit shopping sector and will determine if Amazon is able to dent the dominance of market leader Reliance.

In the New Delhi court, Amazon had argued that an October decision by an arbitrator who had put the Future-Reliance deal on hold is enforceable. While a Delhi court judge ruled in Amazon's favour recently, effectively blocking the deal, that decision was overturned by a two-judge bench on Monday.
Amazon will argue in its Supreme Court challenge that the arbitration order is valid, one of the sources said.
The dispute centres around Future's decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.
Amazon argues that a separate 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn't sell its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list, including Reliance.
Future, India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, has said it will be pushed towards liquidation if the deal falls through.

A division bench of the HC had quashed the stay order on Monday.

The American behemoth has also sought an interim stay against Future’s deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing assets to Reliance Retail.

“Grant special leave to appeal against the impugned interim common order passed on February 8, 2021 by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi,” said Amazon’s prayer.



It argued that the division bench “erred” in lifting the interim order by a single bench as it “ignored the settled principle that an execution court cannot alter the terms of an order much less a court of appeal”.

The division bench order was a setback for Amazon, which has been seeking an interim injunction against the deal, claiming it had the first right of refusal in the planned sale.

The Delhi High Court while lifting the interim stay had noted that Future Retail NSE -9.98 % was not a part of a 2019 agreement between Amazon and Future Coupons, a Future Group holding company.

Ashish K Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal, said, “Special Leave Petition in Supreme Court against an interim order is most likely to be entertained only if it raises a substantial question of law.”

Amazon, which owns a 49% stake in Future Coupons, has alleged that Future Group has breached a contract by agreeing to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing assets to Reliance Retail. The contract gave the ecommerce giant right of first refusal and barred a sale to entities including Reliance, it said.

Amazon also received an interim award in its favour from Singapore International Arbitration Centre.

Lawyers for Future Group and Reliance Retail approached the Delhi High Court and argued that the arbitrator’s interim ruling isn’t valid in India.

Amazon approached the High Court, seeking enforcement of the arbitrator’s award restraining Future Retail from going ahead with the sale deal.

The court had last week directed the deal to be put on hold until its final order. However, this was lifted by a division bench of the court."

The newly listed Indian Railway Finance Corporation and Indigo Paints are also part of this elite list, with their current valuations above $1.5 billion.
The COVID-induced market crash had reduced the tally of companies with market cap of $1 billion and above by almost a fourth to 206 by March 2020, compared to 269 at the end of December 2019. However, a spectacular recovery of 99 per cent took India's market capitalisation to above $2.7 trillion, adding another 96 companies to the billion-dollar club between March 2020 and February 2021. During this period, the rupee has appreciated nearly 4.5 per cent against the greenback (based on the RBI reference exchange rate).

With this, the contribution of these companies to the country's market cap has peaked to 92.2 per cent as on February 8 from nearly 92 per cent at the end of December 2020.
The number of companies with a market cap of $10 billion and above have jumped from 49 to 54 in less than two months, while the count of $25 billion mark cap companies has moved from 17 to 20 during this period. These two categories have a share of 62 per cent and 44.2 per cent, respectively, in the overall market capitalisation.

A New Delhi court last week had sided with Future's partner Amazon Inc's challenge and put Future's $3.4 billion asset sale deal with RIL on hold, which led to an appeal from the Indian retail group.
The e-commerce giant Amazon had reportedly argued that Future breached certain 2019 contracts by agreeing to the deal with RIL.
Future Retail (FRL) had filed an appeal before the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, against an ad interim status quo order dated 2 February 2021 (Impugned Order) passed by a Ld. Single Judge in proceedings filed by Amazon.Com NV Investment Holdings LLC (Amazon) asking for a stay on the proposed transaction with the Reliance Group.
""A Division Bench comprising of the Chief Justice D. N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh has stayed the operation and effect of order passed by the Ld. Single Judge, for the prima facie reason that the company is not a party to the shareholders agreement dated 22 August 2019 executed between Amazon, Future Coupons and the promoters of FRL, under which arbitration was initiated by Amazon in Singapore. The court also observed that statutory authorities cannot be restrained in private litigation from acting in accordance with law,"" Future Retail said in a stock exchange filing.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) gained 1.45% to Rs 1979.75.
Among the Future Group stocks, Future Retail (up 9.77%), Future Lifestyle Fashions (up 10%), Future Consumer (up 9%) and Future Enterprises (up 9%) advanced.
In August 2020, RIL announced the acquisition of retail & wholesale business and logistics & warehousing business from the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,713 crore through its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL).

Buying was seen in Reliance Industries along with select IT and FMCG stocks. However, a sense of fatigue seeped into the market as the rally seems to be slowing down.

""It is important to appreciate the fact that even in 2021 the Bull run continues to be global. But in February India has outperformed most markets and this can be attributed to the optimism generated by the excellent budget. Bank Nifty's outperformance stems from the better than expected Q3 numbers from banks,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Factors driving markets
Stimulus is coming: Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package is expected to pass through Congress before March 15 even without Republican support.
Reflation trade: The early action is coming after another day of so-called reflation trades around the world, in which global markets bid up stocks, oil and gold while US Treasury yields held near 11-month highs.
Bitcoin rally: Bitcoin briefly passed $47,000 for the first time, a 20 per cent rise, before paring gains. It was last at $45,669, energising investors. The move came after Tesla said it invested in the digital currency in January.
How bluechips are doing
After opening in the green, benchmark indices maintained their lead. At 9:46 am, BSE flagship Sensex was up 110 points or 0.21 per cent to 51,459. NSE benchmark Nifty followed and added 57.05 points or 0.38 per cent to 15,173.

In the 50-share pack Nifty, BPCL was the biggest gainer, up 3.31 per cent. IndianOil, Wipro, HDFC Life Insurance, UPL, SBI Life Insurance, Reliance Industries and ONGC were among other gainers.

Tata Motors was the top loser in the pack, down 2.37 per cent. SBI, M&M, Bajaj Auto, Axis Bank, JSW Steel, Bajaj Finance and IndusInd Bank were other losers in the pack.

Broader markets
Broader market indices traded with gains underperforming their headline peers in morning trade. Nifty Smallcap was up 0.1 per cent while Nifty Midcap added 0.07 per cent. The broadest index on NSE -- the Nifty 500 -- was up 0.31 per cent.

Future Retail, Gujarat Gas, Fortis Healthcare, Dixon Technologies, Strides Pharma and IEX were among major gainers from the space while Vakrangee, Affle India, Karur Vysya Bank, Balkrishna Industries, Sun TV and Whirlpool were under selling pressure.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh passed in the interim direction on FRL's appeal challenging the February 2 order of the single-judge bench. While staying the February 2 order, the court said that statutory authorities, like National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Competition Commission of India (CCI) and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), cannot be restrained from proceeding in accordance with law with regard to the deal.
The court also issued notice to Amazon and sought its stand on FRL's appeal by February 26 when it will commence day-to-day hearing of the matter.

On February 2, the single-bench court of Justice JR Midha had blocked Future Group's deal with Reliance Industries after Amazon raised objections. The court had passed the order while hearing Amazon's plea on an emergency award passed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), which restrained Future from selling retail assets to Reliance.
In October last year, Amazon Inc. had approached the SIAC, alleging that Future Group violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance and demanded to halt the deal with Mukesh Ambani-led company.

Reliance and its partner UK's BP Plc on Friday auctioned 7.5 million standard cubic metres per day of incremental gas from the R-series gas field in the KG-D6 block, benchmarking it to a gas marker for the very first time in the country.
The auction was held under the liberalised price discovery rules notified by the government that allowed affiliates of the gas producer to bid and buy natural gas.
Reliance O2C, an affiliate of Reliance, picked up 4.8 mmscmd of gas in Friday's auction that lasted for seven-and-a-half-hours, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
State gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd won 0.85 mmscmd of supplies while Shell picked up 0.7 mmscmd. Adani Total Gas Ltd got 0.1 mmscmd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) 0.2 mmscmd and Torrest Gas 0.02 mmscmd.
Other buyers include IRM Energy (0.1 mmscmd), PIL (0.35 mmscmd) and IGS (0.35 mmscmd), they said.
Sources said the gas was bought at a price of USD 0.18 per million British thermal unit discount to JKM i.e. price of JKM (minus) USD 0.18 with tenures ranging from 3 to 5 years.
Reliance did not respond to email sent for comments.
Reliance O2C is the new unit that holds the firm's refinery and petrochemical assets.
E-bidding process was conducted through an online web-based electronic bidding platform by CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited (CRIS), an independent agency empanelled by Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). CRIS partnered with e-Procurement Technologies Limited (EPTL) and developed e-bidding platform.

The bidding process was carried out as per the guidelines notified by the government in October 2020.
Sources said the bidding process for sale of gas was launched on December 30, 2020 and it witnessed participation from around 15 bidders from city gas distribution sector, steel, power, refineries, petrochemicals, resellers and other industries.
The e-bidding process required bidders to submit their price bids linked to international LNG price benchmark JKM (Japan Korea Marker). The JKM represents price for spot LNG delivered in Asian market and is now being widely used in LNG industry as a marker for in medium/ long term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.
This was second time Reliance-BP conducted an e-bidding process which ran on a dynamic forward auction basis for sale of KG-D6 gas. Earlier in November 2019, 5 mmscmd of natural gas was sold at price in range of around 8.6 per cent of Brent crude oil for tenure ranging from 2 to 6 years.
Reliance-BP started production of gas on December 18 last year from the R Cluster ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the east coast of India.
The duo developing three deep-water gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ -- which together are expected to meet around 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023.
R Cluster is the first of the three projects to come onstream and is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia.
E-bidding auction rules asked bidders to ""quote the variable denoted as 'V' in USD per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) terms.""

""The gas price (in USD/MMBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM + V,"" the bidding notice said.
GCV stands for gross calorific value.
'V' can be a positive, zero or negative number and up to two decimal places but it cannot be less than (-)0.30 USD/MMBtu, it said.
This means users will have to quote -0.30 or higher value of 'V'.
If JKM averaged USD 6 per MMBtu, the price will be USD 5.82 per MMBtu.
But Reliance-BP will only get the government notified cap price for gas from deep-sea fields.
Pricing of gas at JKM will be the first time that domestically produced gas is being sold at rates linked to an international gas benchmark, industry sources said.
Also, this will be the first discovery of gas price since the October 2020 decision of the government setting out uniform e-bidding norms for finding the market price.
That Cabinet decision also allowed the sale of gas to 'affiliates' and so while Reliance-BP affiliate companies couldn't participate in the November 2019 price discovery, they did in e-bidding on February 5.
The government has given operators the freedom to discover market prices but this rate is subject to a pricing ceiling or cap that the government notifies every six months. The cap for six months to March 31, 2021, is USD 4.06 per mmBtu.
And accordingly, Reliance-BP would get only that amount for the gas.
Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL in November 2019 bought the majority of the initial 5 mmscmd of gas planned to be produced from R-Series in the KG-D6 block by bidding between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent of dated Brent price.
In that bidding, Reliance-BP had asked gas users to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.
A floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price was set, which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for securing gas supplies.
Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
Reliance got USD 4.205 per MMBtu for gas from D1 and D3 and MA fields during April 2019 and March 2014. It would have got double of that rate if a new formula proposed by the Rangarajan committee was approved but the new BJP government scrapped it and brought a new formula on pricing gas at rates prevalent in export surplus nations such as the US and Russia.
The rates came to USD 5.05 in 2014 and are currently at USD 1.79 per mmBtu.
Reliance-BP is investing USD 5 billion in bringing to production three deepwater gas projects in block KG-D6 R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ which together are expected to meet about 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12.9 mmscmd while satellites, which are supposed to begin output from the third quarter of the 2021 calendar year, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in the third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake."

Indian Billionaire’s Refiner Buys First Cargo of Carbon-Offset Oil,Bloomberg Quint,https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/indian-billionaire-s-refiner-buys-1st-cargo-of-carbon-offset-oil,"Feb 04 2021, 11:58 AM","RELIANCE

(Bloomberg) -- Indian refiner Reliance Industries Ltd. has taken delivery of 2 million barrels of crude from Occidental Petroleum Corp. that the U.S. oil producer says is carbon neutral.
Reliance -- which operates the world’s biggest refining complex -- said it’s currently evaluating opportunities and partnerships for carbon-neutral oil and the purchase fits with its overall plan to become a net-zero carbon company by 2035, according to an emailed response to questions on Thursday. The cargo meets a tiny fraction of its processing capacity, with the company capable of refining as much as 500 million barrels of crude a year.
Greenhouse gas emissions of the so-called carbon-neutral oil sourced from the Permian basin have been offset, from the well head through to combustion of end products, according to a Jan. 28 statement posted on the website of Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, a unit of Occidental Petroleum.

Occidental is seeking to produce net-zero crude through efforts such as capture and sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide via industrial-scale facilities and the cargo to Reliance is the first step, according to the statement.
Reliance, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, said last year that it’s planning to replace sales of road fuels like diesel and gasoline with cleaner alternatives as it seeks to ride the global energy transition. Its twin refineries, however, were originally designed to process the world’s dirtiest and cheapest crude into high-value petroleum products to maximize profits.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to boost the nation’s green credentials with a goal of doubling renewable power by next year. Explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp. is among companies aiming to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint, with an agreement to source carbon-dioxide from refiner Indian Oil Corp. to inject into its oilfields to increase production.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd has sourced the world's first consignment of 'carbon-neutral oil' from the United States as it looks to become a net zero-carbon company by 2035.
Reliance, which operates the world's largest single location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat with capacity of 68.2 million tonnes a year, got 2 million barrels of consignment Permian basin, the US supplier said in a statement.
Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV), a division of US oil major Occidental, delivered carbon-neutral oil to Reliance, the firm said. ""This transaction, which was arranged in conjunction with Macquarie Group's Commodities and Global Markets group (Macquarie), is the energy industry's first major petroleum shipment for which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the entire crude lifecycle, well head through combustion of end products, have been offset,"" it said.
Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Macquarie will offset carbon dioxide equivalent to that associated with the production, delivery and refining of the crude oil and the use of the resulting product through the retirement of carbon offset credits. This will make the oil 'carbon-neutral'. The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Sea Pearl containing the carbon-neutral oil unloaded the cargo at Jamnagar on January 28.

""This transaction is a first step in the creation of a new market for climate-differentiated crude oil,"" the statement said. It is also a bridge to the development of a further differentiated petroleum product, net-zero oil, which Occidental intends to eventually produce through the capture and sequestration of atmospheric CO2 via industrial-scale direct air capture (DAC) facilities and geological sequestration.

Ambani had in July last year unveiled plans to turn Reliance into a net carbon zero company by 2035. This will be done by embracing new technologies to convert its carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals. OLCV said the oil was produced in the US Permian Basin by Occidental and delivered to Reliance in India.
""Macquarie arranged and structured the bundled offset supply and retirement,"" it said. The offsets were sourced from a variety of projects verified under the Verra Verified Carbon Standard meeting eligibility criteria for the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).
""The volume of offsets applied against the cargo are sufficient to cover the expected GHG emissions from the entire crude lifecycle including oil extraction, transport, storage, shipping, refining, subsequent use, and combustion,"" it said. This type of transaction, which involves the bundling of high-quality carbon offsets with crude oil, is an immediate executable solution that helps promote investments in longer-term, industrial-scale decarbonisation strategies.
It is also a step in the furtherance of Occidental's net-zero ambitions and commitment to addressing climate change today. Occidental, the first US-based international energy company to announce an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with the use of its products by 2050, has been using carbon-dioxide in its enhanced oil recovery operations in the Permian for over 40 years.
""We are taking important initial steps to work with our customers in hard-to-decarbonize industries to offer carbon-neutral and other low-carbon products that will leverage our expertise in carbon management to lower their total carbon impact and address Scope 3 emissions,"" said Richard Jackson, president of OLCV.

The court on Tuesday said the arbitration order was enforceable and asked all Indian authorities to maintain status quo on the transaction, effectively putting the deal on hold."

Biyani said the Future Group was the target of a new form of attack and that a ""corporate battle"" is being fought for supremacy over Indian customers 70 years after India became a republic and also alleged that immense resources are being deployed on influencing Indian society's mindset and belief systems. ""…Amazon is playing the dog in the manger, going all out to create a ruckus…For reasons we never believed earlier but quite evident today, this battle is about ownership of the Indian customer at any cost,"" he said in his letter written on Friday.
Meanwhile, Amazon did not respond to emailed query on the matter. Biyani said he has received numerous letters, phone calls and messages from employees expressing their support, anxiety and queries on the various legal steps being taken by Amazon.
He justified the decision to sell retail, wholesale and some other businesses of Future Group to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's RIL, saying he was left with no other option but to enter in a constructive deal with Reliance Group in the wake of the financial crisis in the retail sector on account of the pandemic. Biyani said Amazon's policy of vexatious litigation and harassment was akin to Greek conquerer Alexander's ruthless ambition to scorch the earth.
He further said that Amazon had relentlessly attacked Future Retail, the board of directors, lenders, promoters, and that those efforts had been unsparing of his close family members, including his father, uncle and children. ""After all, they (Amazon) are inspired to name their product as Alexa… History tells us that Alexander conquered large parts of the world but failed in India. With you on our side and our relentless service to the Indian consumers, we will serve the best interests of our country and will continue to protect our fundamental right to survive, and to serve the Indian consumer,"" Biyani said.
The Future Group founder noted that the deal between Future Coupons and Amazon in August 2019 was to build a coupons and gifting business, create an e-commerce distribution for brands and whenever FDI in retail is permitted, they could participate. ""FDI is not permitted in multi-brand retail, and as is the global policy trend, the government would like home-grown retailers to scale up,"" he added.
In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years. Amazon had dragged the Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance. On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
After this, the Future Group filed a plea with the Delhi High Court. On December 21, a single-member bench rejected the plea to restrain Amazon from writing to regulatory authorities about the SIAC arbitral order but gave a go-ahead to the regulators to decide over the deal. The court had also made several observations indicating that Amazon's attempt to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements Amazon has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be violative of the FEMA FDI rules. Since then, Amazon has also filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking detention of Future Group founders, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets as it sought to block the Future-Reliance deal.

Amazon vs Future: Kishore Biyani likens US giant to Alexander the Great,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/amazon-vs-future-kishore-biyani-likens-us-giant-to-alexander-the-great/story/429613.html,"PTI | January 30, 2021 | Updated 16:54 IST","Amazon.com Inc's bid to stall Future Group's $3.4 billion retail assets sale is similar to Alexander the Great's ""ruthless ambition to scorch the earth"", the Indian group's CEO Kishore Biyani said in an internal staff memo seen by Reuters.
ADVERTISING
Amazon, locked in protracted legal disputes with Future, alleges the Indian firm violated contracts by agreeing to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries last year. Future denies wrongdoing.
The two sides this week traded barbs in a New Delhi court, the latest legal case where Amazon is seeking to block the sale. India's second-largest retailer says the deal is critical for the survival of its 1,700 stores and thousands of employees.
Dubbing it a corporate battle ""for supremacy over Indian customers"", Biyani's staff e-mail late on Friday said Amazon was ""playing the dog in the manger"".
Taking a further dig at Amazon, he said the ""vexatious litigation and harassment makes one wonder about the similarity in ruthless ambition to scorch the earth akin to the Greek Alexander - after all, they are inspired to name their product as Alexa"".
""History tells us that Alexander conquered large parts of the world but failed in India.""
The Macedonian leader's military campaign greatly expanded the Greek-speaking empire throughout the Middle East and parts of Asia, ushering in the Hellenistic age before he died in present-day Iraq in 323 B.C.
Amazon declined to comment on the memo by Biyani, often referred to as India's retail king for transforming the country's retailing in recent decades.
In the latest court case, Amazon has also asked the judge to detain Biyani in a civil prison, arguing his firm ""deliberately"" disobeyed a Singapore arbitrator's October order that put the deal on hold.
Future maintains that arbitration order is not binding.
Its lawyer on Friday said Amazon was trying to block the deal because it will make it difficult for the U.S. firm to compete with Reliance, led by one of Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who is fast expanding into e-commerce.
""Amazon is only interested that Reliance should not improve in India,"" said Future's counsel Harish Salve. The next court hearing is on Monday.
Indian stock exchanges this month cleared Future's deal with Reliance, despite Amazon's repeated requests to regulators to block the deal.
""We are on firm legal footing and this is vindicated by the approvals,"" Biyani said in his memo.

“Amazon’s main concern is that Reliance shouldn't expand its business in India. It is not about ₹1,400 crore (Amazon’s investment in a Future arm). American companies don't want this competition. It is actually a battle between Amazon and Reliance, but it is this company (Future Retail) that will go down,” Salve said when Justice JR Midha asked Amazon’s counsel to spell out its grievance.

The Divisional Bench of the Delhi High Court is hearing a fresh petition filed by Amazon earlier this month that sought to block the ₹25,000-crore deal in addition to attaching Future Retail’s assets.
Salve, appearing on behalf of the Kishore Biyani-promoted FRL said that the financial condition of Future Retail is so dire because of the pandemic, that “If FRL goes into IBC, this investment (made by Amazon) is a bogey.” Amazon had invested ₹1,410 crore in the gifting arm of the Future group in 2019.
Gopal Subramaniam, senior counsel who is appearing on behalf of Amazon, said that FRL had breached multiple clauses of the agreements with the American online retailer. According to him, Amazon had listed ‘restricted persons and entities’ with whom the company could not do business and Reliance was one of such listed entity. “The transaction (between Future and Reliance) is in favour of a restricted entity. The Emergency Award (by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre) found prima facie breach of that agreement,” Subramanium said.
Salve argued that the main objective of the promoters of Future was to save the company and jobs. “Reliance said they will save all the jobs and business. If this transaction cancels, the company will close. Just because this fat American company wants to make money.”
The court will hear the case next on February 1."

Future Retail (FRL) on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that it intends to proceed with the Rs 24,713-crore deal to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries and is seeking approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for demerger.
The HC was hearing Amazon’s plea seeking the enforcement of an emergency arbitrator’s order restraining Future Group from going ahead with the deal. Senior counsel Darius Khambata, on behalf of Future Group, told Justice JR Midha that a petition (by Future Consumers) has been filed before NCLT, Mumbai, for demerger as the group has all the necessary regulatory approvals in place.

The judge asked the Future Group lawyer, “Do you propose to take any action in violation of the Emergency Award in the near future? Would you hold your hand back? The matter is already in regulatory sphere. Some action you’ve already taken. Do you want to take any further action?”
“I want to proceed,” Khambata replied, adding that “if the transaction doesn’t go through, I (FRL) will collapse.” Amazon, in its plea, has accused Future Group of “deliberate and wilful breach and violation” of the SIAC emergency arbitrator’s award, and has sought detention of Future Group’s promoters, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets.
Future Group objected to the maintainability of Amazon’s petition, saying the emergency arbitrator’s order cannot be enforced. “Under Section 17, only the arbitral tribunal can pass orders. What Amazon is seeking to enforce is something else. Whatever order is passed at interim stage is not an order under Section 17… this EA’s order will remain in force only till the final arbitrator is appointed,” Khambata said.
Seeking to restrain FRL and others from taking steps in furtherance of the deal with Reliance and disposing of FRL’s retail assets, senior counsel Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Amazon, argued that the emergency arbitrator passed the interim order after hearing all the parties. He also said he had jurisdiction and that Future Retail was bound by arbitration.
The SIAC on October 25 had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon, barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
He also said that the parties, including promoters and directors of these companies, undertook to abide by the order. Even then, a series of letters were written by FRL to statutory authorities — the CCI and SEBI — saying that the award should be ignored, it is a nullity. Until the award is alive, it is efficacious and no party can sit in judgement and declare an order to be a nullity, the senior counsel said. The court will resume hearing the case on Friday.

The law enforcement agency has filed a case against Amazon after a Delhi High Court bench last month made observations about the deal while hearing Amazon's challenge to acquisition of Future Retail by the Reliance Group.
The US-based firm had objected to Future Group selling its wholesale, retail, warehouse and logistics units to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail.
The Delhi HC had observed that Amazon had indirectly gained control over Future Retail without government's approval, which is a violation of Foreign Direct Investment rules under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).
Amazon had bought 49 per cent stake in Future Coupon, an unlisted firm of Future Group, with the right to buy a stake in the group's listed entity, Future Retail Ltd, after a few years if the government ended the restriction on foreign ownership of multi-brand retailers.
Amazon, in its shareholders' agreement, had barred Future Coupon from selling its assets to 15 firms, including Reliance Industries. However, in August last year, Reliance Retail acquired a 30 per cent stake in Future Group businesses for Rs 24,000 crore, which started the row with Amazon.
Amazon had first approached the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, and after getting an interim award in its favour, it approached Delhi HC.
In its last hearing, the Delhi HC rejected Future Retail's request that Amazon be restrained from writing to SEBI, CCI and other authorities about the arbitration panel's order against its proposed deal with Reliance Retail.

Not only that, Amazon has asked for civil detention in prison for the directors, and promoters of the Future Group. Along with that, Amazon has also appealed for attachment of assets of the Kishore Biyani-owned Future Group.
The appeal is yet to be admitted by the Divisional Bench of Delhi High Court.
On January 20, the Security Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) gave a conditional nod to the Rs 25,000-crore deal between Future Retail and Reliance.
In its letter to the Exchanges, SEBI said: “In light of the above, we hereby advise that we have no adverse observations with limited reference to those matters having a bearing on listing/ delisting/ continuous listing requirements within the provisions of Listing Agreement, so as to enable the company to file the scheme with NCLT,” it said.
Amazon, which had invested Rs 1,400 crore in FCPL, a gifting arm of the Kishore Biyani-owned Future Group in 2019, had moved an arbitration in SIAC.
Post this, Amazon had been writing letters to the Indian authorities seeking their attention and requesting them to not approve the deal. FRL had then moved a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking an injunction against Amazon on the same, which was later rejected.
In December last year, Justice Mukta Gupta had observed that FRL had made a prima facie case in the petition it had filed. However, she hadn’t prohibited Amazon from writing letters to the statutory authorities. However, according to Amazon, it did not receive the remedies it was hoping to get from the courts on the same.

The stock shed 2.4 per cent to Rs 1,893 on the BSE in the intra-day trade on Wednesday, down 10 per cent in the past three trading days. The combined market-cap of RIL's fully paid shares and partly paid shares declined by nearly Rs 1.4 trillion in the three days.
At 10:59 am, the fully paid RIL shares were trading 1.3 per cent lower at Rs 1,914 per share with a market-cap of Rs 12.13 trillion. Meanwhile, RIL's partly paid shares were quoting 3 per cent lower at Rs 1,044 after hitting low of Rs 1,029 in intra-day trade today. The partly paid shares market-cap stood at Rs 44,080 crore, the BSE data showed. The combined market-cap of RIL fully paid and partly paid shares hit a record high of Rs 15.63 trillion on September 16, 2020 in intra-day trade.
For Q3FY21, RIL clubbed refining and petchem into a single Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) business (as per ongoing restructuring) and discontinued disclosures of gross refining margins (GRMs) and petchem production breakup. GRM is a key metric to analyse its oil and petrochemicals vertical, which accounts for about 70 per cent of revenue.

With aggressive plans and product launches in place, Jio Platforms is creating multiple monetization opportunities in the digital space,"" it said.
In Q3FY21, RJio’s gross subscriber additions were steady at 25 million quarter on quarter (QoQ) but net adds were low at 5.2 million viz. lower than the 10.2/7.3 million additions during lockdown quarters of Q1/Q2. Churn for the second quarter stood at 1.63 per cent.
As per the company, it is due to Covid-19 restrictions and other factors (impact of farm protests in our view). ""In our view as Bharti and Vodafone Idea are catching-up on 4G network, Jio is facing the heat of increased competition on subscriber additions,"" analysts at Dolat Capital said in result update.

The global giants who have made this commitment include Accenture, Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Dell Technologies, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, HP, HSBC Holdings, IBM, JLL, KPMG, Mastercard, McKinsey, Nestle, PayPal, PwC, Royal Dutch Shell, Royal Philips, Salesforce, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Sony, Total, UBS, Unilever, Yara International and Zurich Insurance Group.

Announcing the details during its online Davos Agenda Summit, the WEF said a total of 61 business leaders have so far committed to the core Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, which offer a core set of 31 universal, comparable disclosures focused on people, planet, prosperity and governance that companies can report on, regardless of industry or region.

The move signals that private sector leaders view environmental, social and governance factors as critical to the success and long-term viability of all businesses and a unified voice is gathering pace on a global solution for non-financial reporting, the WEF said.

The metrics are aimed at strengthening the ability of companies and investors to benchmark progress on sustainability matters, thereby improving decision-making and enhancing transparency and accountability regarding the shared and sustainable value companies create.

The business leaders and their organisations have committed to ""reflect the core metrics in their reporting to investors and other stakeholders (such as annual report, sustainability report, proxy statements, or other materials) by reporting on the metrics most relevant to their business or briefly explaining why a different approach is more appropriate"".

They will also publicly support this work and encourage their business partners to do so and promote the further convergence of existing ESG standards, frameworks and principles to support progress towards a globally accepted solution for non-financial reporting on common ESG metrics.

In making these commitments, business leaders are signalling that ESG factors are increasingly critical to the success and long-term viability of all businesses, the WEF said.

""Stakeholder capitalism becomes now really mainstream,"" WEF Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab said.

""The public commitments from companies to report not only on financial matters but also their ESG impacts are an important step towards a global economy that works for progress, people and the planet,"" he added.

Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said, ""We have to deliver great returns for our shareholders and help drive progress on society's most important priorities.""

The WEF, in collaboration with Bank of America, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, curated the set of 21 core and 34 expanded metrics over the past two years with the support of over 140 stakeholders."
Shares of Reliance Industries plunge 6% on disclosure concerns,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/shares-of-reliance-industries-plunge-6-on-disclosure-concerns-121012600037_1.html,"Last Updated at January 26, 2021 00:58 IST","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) plunged nearly six per cent — the most since November 2 — after analysts raised concerns over disclosure standards. The country’s most-valuable firm on Friday reported record quarterly profit for the quarter ended December 31, but didn’t disclose gross refining margins (GRM), a key metric to analyse its oil and petrochemicals vertical, which accounts for about 70 per cent of revenue.
“Transparency levels are falling across businesses. RIL has stopped reporting a key matrix — GRM — altogether. Similarly, it has ceased providing division-wise turnover breakdown for retail and Jio’s key driver FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) lacks granularity,” said Edelweiss analysts, led by Jal Irani, in a note.
Beating analysts’ estimates, RIL reported 13 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit to Rs 13,100 crore. The performance of the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and retail verticals missed expectations, while telecom arm surpassed estimates.
“The company has ceased providing disclosures on separate refining and petchem performance. The reason for this miss is hence difficult to ascertain; we reckon it was largely due to sustained refining weakness,” Citigroup analysts, led by Saurabh Handa, said in a note to clients.

Edelweiss said RIL’s profit managed to beat estimate “entirely driven by investment income and a near-zero tax liability.”

Shares of RIL fell Rs 114.5, or 5.6 per cent, to end at Rs 1,935. From the peak of Rs 2,324 on September 16, RIL shares have dropped nearly 17 per cent and the company has lost nearly Rs 2.6 trillion in market value. The slide has put at risk its tag as “India’s most-valuable firm”. RIL’s current market cap is Rs 12.75 trillion, ahead of Tata Consultancy Services’ at Rs 12.35 trillion.

Some analysts believe the company could continue to underperform the markets. Macquarie’s Aditya Suresh and Abhinil Dahiwale said they expect RIL’s earnings in FY22-23 to be 25 per cent below consensus estimate. They have a price target of Rs 1,350 for the stock.
“We forecast FY21 core EPS to fall 10 per cent to Rs 60 (previous estimate Rs 55), followed by a recovery to Rs 70-80 (rounded) in FY22-23, versus consensus at Rs 95-115, respectively,” they wrote. “Today’s stock price implies flawless execution on RIL’s multi-pronged growth aspirations, combined with a premium over recent deal valuations.”
Macquarie said the headline earnings growth for the December quarter was impressive, but was supported by 1 per cent effective tax rate and $106 million investment gain for the retail division.
“Adjusting for this and adding back an impairment in exploration and production, on our estimates underlying EPS was down 30 per cent YoY,” it said.
RIL has taken giant steps towards reducing its dependency on its energy business and is working towards becoming a telecom and retail titan. The company last year raised $27 billion from global investors as part of this goal."
Amazon seeks injunction to restrain Future Reliance deal,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-seeks-injunction-to-restrain-future-reliance-deal/articleshow/80453405.cms,"Last Updated: Jan 26, 2021, 12:05 AM IST","Mumbai: Amazon has approached the Delhi High Court seeking injunction to restrain Future Group in filing any application with regulators to complete its deal with Reliance and enforcing the interim order passed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). In its suit filed Monday, Amazon has asked the court to restrict Future Retail (FRL) from directly or indirectly taking any steps to sell assets or shares without their written prior consent.

Reliance Retail, a unit of Reliance Industries, agreed to buy the retail assets of the Future Group on a slump sale basis for about Rs 25,000 crore, it was announced in August. Amazon, which owns a 49% stake in Future Coupons (FCPL), a Future Group holding company, objected to the deal and approached SIAC which passed an interim order in October last year to put the transaction on hold until it gave a final ruling on their plea.

""Directing to implement the directions in the said order in letter and spirit and set right the wrongs done in violation of the order and not allow any perpetuation of any further wrong-doing including passing resolutions and making appropriate statements to statutory authorities and the public at large,"" said Amazon in its petition, reviewed by ET.

Experts said foreign seated interim arbitral awards in India are not enforceable directly.

""Enforcement can be sought by filing a civil suit or by filing an application under section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Along with a suit, an application seeking interim injunction can also be made,"" said Ashish K Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal.



In December, the high court had rejected FRL’s plea to stop Amazon from intervening in the transaction with Reliance but also observed that the deal was lawful. It also noted that the arbitration agreement was between promoter entity FCPL and Amazon, and not with FRL and conflating this to encompass all Future Group retail assets would violate foreign exchange rules.

Amazon challenged the observation that Reliance Retail’s deal to acquire the assets of Future Retail Ltd was valid and said the view of the single-judge bench was “illegal, invalid, unjustified and liable to be quashed and set aside” in a petition filed nearly a fortnight ago.

Last week, based on Sebi’s observations, the stock exchange said it has no adverse observations on the listing or de-listing requirements and that the scheme can be filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in addition to no-objection certificates from creditors and minority shareholders.

However, the stock exchange also said details of complaints made by Amazon, the submissions of FRL, the counter-submissions of Amazon, all proceedings pending and completed in the Delhi High Court and the award of the emergency arbitrator in the Singapore International Arbitration Centre should be brought to the notice of shareholders of the listed entities involved in the scheme while getting their approval for the scheme."
Reliance Industries rating – Buy: Weak O2C behind miss on earnings,Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/reliance-industries-rating-buy-weak-o2c-behind-miss-on-earnings/2178711/,"January 26, 2021 1:45 AM","Covid-19 impact is still visible; FY21e EPS up 25% on interest income, lower tax; TP revised to Rs 2,400; prospects remain bright
Refining margins remain weak, but petchem is seeing a recovery.
RIL’s Q3 consolidated Ebitda (+14% q-q, -5% y-y) was 3% below our/ consensus estimates. The miss was largely on energy business with standalone Ebitda (+14% q-q, -33% y-y) 12% below our estimates. RIL has reorganised its reporting to combine the refining and petchem segments as a single O2C (oil to chemicals) segment.
With the changed reporting, it has not disclosed refining GRM, which makes quarterly comparisons difficult. Petchem was further strong q-q (polymer margins were record high, intermediate volume/margins also better); thus, we believe that refining was likely weaker vs our GRM forecast of $6/bbl ($5.7/bbl in Q2).

Despite carving out of the fuel retail business and a weak environment (footfalls at 75% of pre-COVID-19, flat y-y), retail Ebitda (+53% q-q, 13% y-y) was 15% ahead of our estimate. But, adjusted for Rs 7.8 bn investment income, retail Ebitda was up 15% q-q and 14% below our estimates. In Jio, subs addition was muted (gross 25 mn, but net 5 mn), but due to higher blended ARPU of Rs 151 (vs Rs 145 in Q2), Jio Ebitda (+8% q-q, 45% y-y) was 1% above us.
Pandemic still impacting key segments
Refining margins remain weak, but petchem is seeing a recovery. As the economy further opens up, volume growth should get stronger in retail. In Jio, subscriber growth should pick up for mobile and broadband. But tariff hike is overdue and is a potential catalyst, in our view.
Outperformance likely to sustain
We cut FY21F Ebitda 14% on weak operating earnings, but with higher interest income/lower tax, our forecast EPS rises 25% in FY21F & 5-9% in FY22/23F. After down 9% in FY21F, we expect Ebitda to grow 62% in FY22F (low base, volume/margins recovery, Jio tariff hikes), and 28% in FY23F. We expect 33% earnings CAGR over FY20 to FY23F.
We continue to value RIL on SOTP basis with unchanged EV/Ebitda multiples (refining 7x, petchem 8x, Jio 11x, core retail at 30x, non-core at 7x). We value Future’s retail business at Rs 100 (unchanged), and adjust our TP for recent stake sales in Retail. Our revised TP of Rs 2,400 implies 17% upside. RIL has outperformed NIFTY for the past six years, and with strong growth the outperformance will likely sustain. Reiterate Buy.

Reliance Ebitda back to pre-pandemic levels driven by consumer businesses: Moody’s,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/reliance-ebitda-back-to-pre-pandemic-levels-driven-by-consumer-businesses-moodys,": Monday, January 25, 2021, 11:40 PM IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has seen pre-tax profit recover to pre-pandemic levels on the back of continued growth in consumer businesses, Moody's Investors Service said on Monday.
The oil-to-retail-to-telecom behemoth on Friday reported a 0.7 per cent Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation) growth for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year.
""A strong performance in digital services and retail segments underpinned the improvement in consolidated earnings, a credit positive,"" Moody's said commenting on the earnings.

Continued growth in earnings combined with the company's strong balance sheet with zero net debt on a reported basis will keep Reliance's credit metrics strong for its Baa2 rating over the next 12-18 months, it said.
Its digital services segment reported a 48.4 per cent Ebitda growth driven by an increase in subscriber additions, higher average revenue per user and growth in the company's fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) business. The company's retail segment earning grew by 13 per cent on the back of an increase in the number of retail stores and increased shopper footfalls.
Moody's expected earnings within digital services to continue to grow over the next 12-18 months on the back of further ramp-up of its home and enterprise broadband services.
For the retail segment, it expected shopper traffic and sales to grow in subsequent quarters as consumer sentiment improves following the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines and the economic recovery starts kicking in.
""However, increasing competition and a second wave of the virus are risks to growth within the segment,"" it said.
Moody's said weak refining margins continue to weigh on the earnings performance of the oil-to-chemical (O2C) segment, although earnings have started to recover from the lows seen in 2020.
The recovery is mainly because of an increase in refinery throughput and sale volumes following a planned shutdown in the previous quarter, and stronger petrochemical spreads.
""We expect earnings from the O2C segment to grow over the next 12-18 months, driven by continued recovery in refinery throughput and product demand.
""We also expect refining margins to improve from current levels which will further contribute to higher earnings, but despite the expected improvement, margins will continue to remain below midcycle levels over the next 12-18 months,"" it said.
While the firm's upstream oil and gas exploration business is not a significant contributor to consolidated earnings, the segment's earnings contribution is expected to improve over the next 2-3 years following the commencement of gas production from the KG-D6 basin in the Bay of Bengal.
In December 2020, Reliance commenced gas production from one of the fields, while two other fields are expected to start production over the next 6-12 months.
Since April 2020, Reliance has raised around Rs 2.5 lakh crore (USD 34 billion) through a combination of stake sales in its retail and digital services segments and a rights issue offering.
This has helped the company reduce its reported net debt to zero.
Around 85 per cent of the proceeds have been received, with the last tranche of Rs 39,840 crore pertaining to the rights issue offering likely to be called during 2021.
""We expect Reliance's intensity of capital spending will decrease compared with historical levels such that the company's internal cash flow generation will be sufficient to meet its future spending needs.
""Consequently, we expect that the company's credit metrics will remain strongly positioned for its current Baa2 rating over the next 12-18 months,"" the rating agency said."
Reliance Industries recalibrating business across oil to retail chain,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/reliance-industries-recalibrating-business-across-oil-to-retail-chain,": Monday, January 25, 2021, 11:37 PM IST","Reliance Industries Ltd, India's biggest firm, has reorganised oil to chemicals business, recalibrated retail operations, and is doubling down on its promise to offer 5G telecom services for the next leg of growth.
This plus focus on green energy and sustainable materials of the future, integrated 5G solutions, reorganisation of retail for new commerce and ramp-up of domestic gas production all point to the next leg of growth, analysts said in their commentary on third-quarter earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
Goldman Sachs said the sequential improvement in EBIDTA showcased a shift towards FCF generation, pivot towards a suite of digital launches sustaining sequential growth both for Jio and Retail, and focus on further chemical integration as O2C carve out is underway.

Telecom tariff hikes, new product launches (eg non-grocery e-commerce) and a potential energy business stake sale can reverse the pullback in Reliance shares since mid-September, it said.
HSBC Securities said the introduction of a single O2C segment, stronger fashion-driven retail and low effective tax were key surprises from results. ""We like the business direction but believe retail execution still needs to evolve; O2C and digital won't have enough tailwinds."" ""RIL is morphing into a pure consumer company with a reporting structure which now includes a single O2C segment, vs the traditional refining and petchem segments, as it endeavours to move further downstream towards consumer products,"" it said.
Bank of America and BofA Securities (BofAML) said RIL is looking to incubate new energy/materials platforms. ""Focus from O2C carve-out is to maximize profitability from downstream chemicals, reduce transportation fuels footprint in a phased manner."" Management expects a strong rebound in demand for fuels/ downstream products and net subscriber additions in Jio to bounce-back.
Morgan Stanley said the restructuring of oil to chemicals (O2C), focus on green energy and sustainable materials of the future, integrated 5G solutions, IoT, reorganising retail for new commerce, and ramp-up of domestic gas production all point to the next leg of growth.
""RIL reorganised its oil to chemicals business, transferred the retail fuel business from retail to O2C business, and laid out more details on its plans to grow sustainable materials and green energy investments.
""It also recalibrated its retail operations and converted some stores to e-commerce fulfilment centres, expanded tie-ups with Kirana stores to 23 cities, and in digital, highlighted progress on IoT devices and 5G solutions, some of which would be available in 2H21,"" it said.
These are pointers to its next investment cycle that may require $50-60 billion, it said.
Kotak, however, said RIL's operating performance across segments was weaker than its expectations and debt reduction was lower as a significant portion of inflows from capital raise and cash profits was once again utilized in capex, working capital and repayment of creditors.
CLSA said while key performance metrics were not disclosed for refining and petchem as this has now been merged as the O2C segment, the conversion of some grocery stores into fulfilment centres hurt the retail revenue/Ebitda.
Citi said the company has ceased providing disclosures on separate refining margins and petchem performance, as management believes both segments need to be viewed as one downstream business going forward following the completion of the internal restructuring and the longer-term plan to increase integration between refining and petrochemicals by reducing transportation fuel production (still at 60%).
While Nomura said it believes that refining was likely weaker, Bernstein said exploration and production (E&P) profits have bottomed with start-up of gas production from KG-D6 block in the eastern offshore.
R-Cluster in KG-D6 block started production in December and will reach peak output of 12.9 million standard cubic meters per day in 2H21.
JM Financial said retail business is gradually recovering post lockdown while margin was healthy at around 7% due to rebound in high margin fashion and lifestyle segment to pre-Covid levels.
UBS said EBITDA share of consumer businesses in total EBITDA jumped to 46 per cent.
BNP Paribas said as per the company, the reorganization will enable it to garner attractive growth opportunities and better internal synergies. ""Hence, the retail business revenue declined year-on-year as transportation fuel revenue is now clubbed under O2C business."" JP Morgan said there were no updates on the sale of a 20% stake in O2C to Saudi Aramco as well as the acquisition of retail assets of Future Group."

“Today, the market has formed “the three black crows candlestick pattern”. Consisting of three consecutive bearish candles at the end of a bullish trend, the three black crows signals a shift of control from the bulls to the bears. In brief, the Nifty 50 index is heading for 14100/13900 levels, (BSE Sensex 48100/47500), if it breaks 14200 (BSE Sensex 48400) decisively. On the higher side 14350/49000 and 14500/49400 would be crucial levels to surpass and sustain. As the market is falling vertically, we are of the view that ahead of the budget we should look for adding strong stocks and selective stocks to our positional portfolio between 14100/13900 (48100/47500) levels.”
Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities-
“Nifty has fallen for the third consecutive session. This has happened after about 4 months. Poor advance-decline ratio hints at broader profit-taking. Pre Budget nervousness has resulted in some unloading. Locking up of large sums in the recent IPOs have also led to this sell-off. 14123-14148 is the next support band for the Nifty.”
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services-
“Indian markets witnessed a highly volatile trade and closed in red due to weak global market and reports of Indo-China border tension. The downside was equally contributed by all the sectors except pharma which traded in the green. Policy decisions of the US Fed meeting which will commence tomorrow will drive the global market in the coming days. We have seen Indian markets being highly volatile these days and this trend is expected to continue this week as we inch closer to the Union Budget.”

“A Volatile session of trade today which saw selling in heavyweights despite strength seen in pockets like 2 Wheelers & Pharmaceuticals. Event-specific price action was seen in Paint Sector stocks while Tyre stocks succumbed to profit-booking.”
Sumeet Bagadia Executive Director Choice Broking –
“Technically, the benchmark index has been trading in its Upward Rising Channel Formation since the last many days which is a continuation formation and indicates an upside movement. Moreover, it has been trading above its 21 days moving average which shows a positive trend for the time being. At present, Nifty has strong support of 14200 level which is a lower band of the formation as well as recent bottom also placed at 14200 level while upside resistance comes at 14500.”
Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities –
“One more volatile session ended on a negative note as nifty closed a day at 14239 with loss of nearly one per cent and formed three black crows candle pattern which is bearish in nature. The index has breached all good support which hints if index managed to sustain below today’s low then index may hit 14k mark soon which is strong support on the downside, on the higher side now index has good resistance near 14350-14440 zone again that would be profit booking levels for longs.”

Reliance Industries also didn’t provide gross refining margin for the third quarter as it reorganised the refining and petrochemicals into the oil-to-chemicals business. It reported an impairment of Rs 15,691 crore on its shale gas investments due to the market environment, reduction in activity by the operator and recent operational performance.

It was for the first time when Reliance Industries reported integrated earnings of its O2C business in its third-quarter financial results. Last year, Reliance started working on hiving off the O2C business into a separate unit for a possible stake sale to companies such as Saudi Aramco.

Reliance Industries spins off oil-to-chemical business into new unit,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/reliance-industries-spins-off-oil-to-chemical-business-into-new-unit/story/429014.html,"PTI | January 25, 2021 | Updated 12:38 IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd has completed spin-off of the firm's oil-to-chemical business into a new unit that will help it pursue growth opportunities with strategic partnerships, the company has said.
The oil-to-chemical (O2C) business unit holds Reliance's oil refinery and petrochemical assets and retail fuel business but not upstream oil and gas producing fields such as KG-D6 and textiles business.
Reliance for the first time reported integrated earnings of the O2C business in its third quarter financial results. Previously, refining and petrochemical businesses were reported separately while fuel retailing revenue was part of the firm's overall retail business.
In the October-December 2020 earnings statement, refining and petrochemical as well as fuel retailing businesses earnings were reported as one. As a result, it did not give refining margins - the most sought after number to assess the firm's oil refining business.
""Reorganising refining and petrochemicals as oil-to-chemicals (O2C) reflects new strategy as well as management matrix,"" the company said in a post earning investor presentation.
This, it said, will ""facilitate holistic and agile decision making"" as well as ""pursue attractive opportunities for growth with strategic partnerships"".
Reliance started work on hiving off the O2C business into a separate unit last year for a possible stake sale to companies such as Saudi Aramco.
It values the O2C business at USD 75 billion and has been in talks with Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) for sale of a 20 per cent interest.
The company, however, did not mention discussions with Aramco, which are said to have hit a valuation roadblock.
The reorganisation would ""drive the move towards further downstream and closer to customers"" and ""provide sustainable and affordable energy and materials solutions to meet India's growing needs,"" the firm said in the presentation.
Reliance O2C Limited houses oil refining and petrochemical plants and manufacturing assets, bulk and wholesale fuel marketing, and Reliance's 51 per cent interest in retail fuel joint venture with BP of the UK.
The O2C unit also houses the firm's Singapore and the UK-based oil trading subsidiaries and marketing subsidiary, Reliance Industries Uruguay Petroquimica SA.
It also houses Reliance Ethane Pipeline Limited that operates a pipeline between Dahej in Gujarat and Nagothane in Maharashtra as well as 74.9 per cent stake that Reliance holds in the joint venture with Sibur.
Its very large ethane carriers, gas pipelines such as one that transports coal-bed methane from its CBM blocks, overseas oil and gas asset holding company Reliance Industries (Middle East) DMCC, and domestic exploration and production assets would not form part of the O2C unit.
Also, Reliance's textiles business as operated out of the Naroda site, Baroda township and land, including cricket stadium, Jamnagar power assets, and Sikka Ports and Terminals Limited would also not be part of the O2C unit.
Ambani had in July 2019 stated that the process of spinning of O2C into a separate subsidiary would be completed by early 2021.
Reliance owns and operates twin oil refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.
It is also the country's largest petrochemical manufacturer with units at Jamnagar, Dahej, Hazira, Nagothane, Vadodara, Patalganga, Silvassa, Barabanki, and Hoshiarpur.
The company holds a 66.6 per cent stake in the KG-D6 block where it is investing about USD 5 billion in developing a second set of gas discoveries along with BP.
It also has a similar stake in the NEC-25 block in the Bay of Bengal and operates two CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh. These upstream assets are not part of the O2C unit.
""Reliance O2C (is) one of the most integrated manufacturers of value-added fuels, chemicals and materials,"" the presentation said. ""O2C to maximize downstream, reduce transportation fuels and create clean and green energy platforms.

""At a time when the Indian economy is poised for a confident recovery, we at Reliance are humbled that we have been able to contribute to it with our company's impressive performance in the third quarter of FY21,"" chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said. ""We have delivered strong operational results during the quarter with a robust revival in O2C and retail segments, and a steady growth in our digital services business. I am proud that Reliance has employed 50,000 more people since March 2020,"" he added.
Outstanding debt as on 31 December 2020 was Rs 257,413 crore ($35.2 billion). Cash and cash equivalents as on 31 December 2020 were at Rs 220,524 crore ($30.2 billion). Balance capital commitment receivables (on account of rights issue) are in excess of quarter-end net debt levels.
Reliance Jio
Jio Platforms (JPL) reported net profit of Rs 3,489 crore in Q3 FY21, a rise of 15.5% over Rs 3,020 crore in Q2 September 2020 (Q2 FY21). Revenue from operations rose 5.3% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 19,475 crore in Q3 FY21. EBITDA rose 6.4% sequentially to Rs 8,483 crore during the quarter. EBITDA margin increased 46 bps to 43.6% in Q3 FY21 as against 43.1% in Q2 FY21 owing to growing revenue and operating leverage.
Total customer base as on 31 December 2020 stood at 410.8 million, net addition of 5.2 million customers. Average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter of Rs 151 per subscriber per month as against Rs 145 per subscriber per month in the trailing quarter.
Total data traffic during the quarter of 1,586 crore GB (28.4% YoY growth). Total voice traffic during the quarter of 97,496 crore minutes (18% YoY growth). During Q3 FY21, average data consumption per user per month was strong at 12.9 GB and average voice consumption was at 796 minutes per user per month.
FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) services witnessed increased uptake during the quarter on the back of unique offering and widespread network across the country.
Reliance Retail
Value of sales and services for Q3 FY21 decreased by 8% QoQ to Rs 37,845 crore while EBITDA for Q3 FY21 increased by 54% QoQ to a record Rs 3,087 crore, with underlying operating margin (excluding the impact of the investment income) at 7%, coming in ahead of last quarter and same time last year. This was led by near doubling of fashion and lifestyle earnings, continued benefits from cost management initiatives and a boost from higher investment income of Rs 775 crore.
Overall footfalls remained at similar levels to last quarter but still lower than pre-COVID levels. Overall revenue was further affected by the transfer out of the fuel retailing business to the RIL-BP JV and the decision to convert Reliance Market stores to fulfilment centers to enable city expansion of new commerce.
Oil to Chemicals (O2C):
Segment Revenues for Q3 FY21 increased by 10% QoQ to Rs 83,838 crore primarily on account of higher volumes mainly in transportation fuels, PTA and polyester supported by improved product realization across polymers, intermediates and polyester.
Segment EBITDA for Q3 FY21 improved by 10.3% QoQ to Rs 9,756 crore primarily on account of higher product sales and shifting of product placement from exports to domestic market. On O2C basis, total throughput has increased from 16.8 MMT to 18.2 MMT on Q-o-Q basis due to improved product demand in Q3 and scheduled shutdown taken in Q2.
Utilization rates across RIL O2C facilities remained at high levels in Q3 FY21. Refining throughput was 16.7 MMT an increase of 9.2% over 2Q FY21. Cracker operating rate was 96% impacted by scheduled shutdown of ROGC at Jamnagar. LPG production was maximized based on favorable economics over marginal Alkylate volumes.
Oil and Gas (Exploration & Production) Business
Segment revenues for Q3 FY21 increased by 21.4% QoQ to Rs 431 crore primarily due to higher commodity price realization and incremental production from R-Cluster.
Production and gas supplies from R Cluster field, India's first ultra-deepwater gas field in block KGD6 off the east coast of India, have commenced on 18th December 2020. Production for the period 18th December 2020 to 31st December 2020 is 1.6 BCF (RIL's share). It is expected to reach plateau production of about 12.9 MMSCMD in H2 CY21.
Media Business:
The segment revenues recovered fully from the pandemic impact in Q3 FY21, rising sharply by 34% QoQ to Rs 1,422 crore. Festive season buoyancy and sustained elevation in media consumption largely eliminated the COVID-linked drag on ad-spending. Revenue of the primary business of broadcast and digital media (i.e ex-film production) grew 35% QoQ and 1% YoY, as a result of sustained viewership and faster than expected recovery in Ad revenues. EBITDA for Q3 FY21 grew 96% QoQ and 21% YoY to Rs 324 crore. EBITDA margins rose to about 23% as all three verticals(Entertainment, TV and Digital News) improved their profitability levels.

Reliance Industries shares fall nearly 5% as Covid-19 hits oil business,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/reliance-industries-shares-fall-nearly-5-as-covid-19-hits-oil-business-101611555508260.html,"PUBLISHED ON JAN 25, 2021 11:53 AM IST","Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd fell as much as 4.7% in early trade on Monday after the Indian conglomerate posted a sharp drop in quarterly revenue from its dominant oil-to-chemicals business.
Reliance, which operates the world's largest refining complex, said on Friday revenue from its oil-to-chemicals division fell nearly 30% in the three months ended Dec. 31.
Total revenue slid 21% to 1.24 trillion rupees, and the company said its operations and revenue during the period were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Reliance, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has built leading consumer-facing businesses in recent years to diversify away from its mainstay energy arm, but a coronavirus-driven slump in fuel demand has weighed on the Mumbai-headquartered group's recent results.
RIL's cyclicals business reporting has become opaque, with no disclosures on gross refining margin (GRM) data this time around, BOB Capital Markets said in a note over the weekend.
""We need to see earnings traction to justify the recent surge in stock price as the rally factors in positives from debt reduction. O2C (the oil to chemicals business) earnings growth remains elusive in the current pandemic-led uncertainty,"" the brokerage added.
Reliance, which did not share the GRM, announced a reorganisation on Friday, according to which it now houses its oil refining, fuel retailing and petrochemicals operations together.
Reliance shares gained about 5.8% last week in the run-up to the results but were flat for this year after a more than 32% gain last year.
The company raised about $26 billion last year from investors like Google and Facebook for its digital and retail arms.

Reliance Industries stock dips 6% post Q3; analysts see up to 21% upside,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/reliance-industries-stock-dips-5-post-q3-analysts-see-up-to-21-upside-121012500255_1.html,"Last Updated at January 25, 2021 15:57 IST","Reliance Industries shares tanked as much nearly 5.7 per cent and hit an intra-day low of Rs 1,933 on the BSE on Monday as investors booked profits after the company announced its results for the third quarter ended December 2020 (Q3FY21). The numbers were unveiled post market hours on Friday.
The oil-to-telecom conglomerate's consolidated net profit of Rs 13,101 crore in the December quarter jumped 37 per cent sequentially, and beat Street expectations of a 32 per cent QoQ PAT improvement. On a yearly basis, the profit grew 12.5 per cent as lower expenses cushioned earnings even as revenues declined. READ ABOUT IT HERE
According to Bloomberg estimates, the company’s top line was seen at Rs 1.209 trillion in the December quarter, while the bottom line was expected to be at Rs 10,107 crore. In segment-wise revenue, the company’s digital services was the only business that saw an uptick - of 33 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis at Rs 23,678 crore. Oil-to-chemicals, oil and gas, and retail were down 30 per cent, 51 per cent, and 19 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.
At close, the counter was at Rs 1,940 apiece, down 5.4 per cent, and was the top loser on the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex. A combined 826.36 million shares changed hands on the NSE and BSE today.
Here's how brokerages have interpretted the result.
Nomura
Target Price: Rs 2,400 | Reco: Buy
RIL's 3Q consolidated EBITDA was 3 per cent below our estimates. The miss was largely on energy business with standalone EBITDA 12 per cent below our estimates. RIL has reorganized its reporting to combine the refining and petchem segments as a single O2C segment. With the changed reporting, it has not disclosed refining GRM, which makes quarterly comparisons difficult. Petchem was further strong QoQ (polymer margins were record high, intermediate volume/margins also better); thus, we believe that refining was likely weaker vs our GRM forecast of $6/bbl ($5.7/bbl in 2Q).
We continue to value RIL on SOTP basis with unchanged EV/EBITDA multiples (refining 7x, petchem 8x, Jio 11x, core retail at 30x, non-core at 7x). We value Future's retail business at Rs 100 (unchanged), and adjust our TP for recent stake sales in Retail. Our revised TP of Rs 2,400 implies 17 per cent upside. RIL has outperformed the NIFTY for the past six years, and with strong growth the outperformance will likely sustain.

Credit Suisse

TP: Rs 1,930 | Reco: Neutral

Q3FY21 was below expectation on lower Retail sales, weak O2C margins, and low subscriber addition in Jio. Going forward, key catalysts are launch of affordable 4G smartphone which can aid towards subscriber addition; strategy to transition kirana stores buying from cash-and-carry to JioMart, which could expandits reach; update on O2C deal as oil prices recovered; launch of integrated digital health/education apps; and growth plans of Financial Services.

Our estimate is lower than consensus by 12-13 per cent due to moderate ramp-up of Refining margins and price hike in Telecom starting mid-FY22. We cut FY22E/FY23E EPS by 4 per cent/3 per cent as we push Jio's 500 million subscriber base to mid-FY23 and factor in slower Retail recovery.

Goldman Sachs

TP: Rs 2,390 | Reco: Buy
Given the in-line result, we make no changes to our estimates or 12-month TPs of Rs 2,390/US$63.69 GDR which remain based on a SOTP methodology. We continue to use 8X CY22E (FY23E) to value the chemical business, and 6.5X for refining and marketing; we use EV/EBITDA to value the core refining and petchem business, and we use DCF to value the high-growth telecom and retail business (online and offline). We see 17% upside in our base case. Risk-reward remains positive, with 50% upside in our bull case and 9% downside in our bear case scenarios.
BofA Securities

TP: Rs 2,355 | Reco: Buy

RIL’s 3Q EBITDA/EBIT beat our estimate by 5 per cent/8 per centled by better retails and margins. 3Q normalized PAT at Rs 13,100 crore was 18 per cent higher than our estimate due lower than expected int income.

We reiterate buy on favorable risk-reward. Catalysts: 1) App in app integration of JioMart in Whatsapp; 2) Potential launch of low cost Jio-Google smartphones and 3) Material uptake of fiber net adds.

JPMorgan

TP: Rs 1,990 | Reco: Neutral

EBITDA had a small miss across most segments, though continued 0% tax rate, and lower interest expenses drove an in line reported PAT. With Refining and Petchem folded into O2C, the segment was a miss and RIL did not disclose reported GRM’s as it now would report on an integrated O2C basis. We are surprised by the lack of any mention on the pet coke gasifier, where profitability should have been high given the sharply higher spot LNG prices.

While Jio ARPU’s were a beat, net subs addition was a large miss and this would worry markets given that FY22-23 earnings growth is dependent on tariff hikes. Retail EBITDA ex of Investment Income was soft.

While we maintain our FY22-23 earnings, 3Q highlights that earnings outlook for FY22 is increasingly binary in nature and entirely dependent on a) sharp refining recovery and b) large telecom tariff hikes with continued sub additions.

BNP Paribas

TP: Rs 2,367 | Reco: Buy

We reiterate our BUY rating on RIL with a revised SoTP based TP of Rs 2,367. The lower TP is largely due to a change in the net debt position as well as marginal tweak to earnings. Our FY21E earnings increases almost entirely due to the benefit from lower taxes and lower interest expense which should continue for 4QFY21 as well. We continue to like RIL shares but believe the near term weakness should continue until we see economics of the O2C business improve.

Bernstein

TP: Rs 2,470 | Reco: Outperform
Reliance Industries reported highest quarterly net profit of Rs 14,894 crore or Rs 19.9/share for 3QFY21 (+40% q-o-q, +26% y-o-y) which was 47 per cent higher than consensus estimates of Rs 10,110 crore. YTD net earnings totaled Rs 33,334 crore which is 86 per cent of our FY estimates and 83% for consensus. The strong beat came across all businesses and lower finance costs.

Citi

TP: Rs 2,130 | Reco: Neutral

We make 0-8% changes to FY21-23E earnings (9M performance, lower taxes). Maintain Neutral given lack of near-term triggers & limited upside.

Macquarie

TP: Rs 1,350 | Reco: Underperform

We cut our FY22-23 EPS estimates ~3%, and note that our estimates still remain ~25% below cons. Against headline EPS growth of 10% Y/Y, we estimate underlying EPS was down ~30% in the Dec-Q. Today's stock price implies flawless execution on RIL’s multi-pronged growth aspirations combined with a premium over recent deal valuations.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services
TP: Rs 2,325 | Reco: Buy
Consolidated Dec’20 debt stood at Rs 2.57 trillion cash and cash and equivalents at Rs 2.2 trillion. The company received Rs 73,500 crore in 3QFY21, and considering balance commitments of Rs 39,800 crore, ceteris paribus, the company's net cash stood at Rs 3,000 crore.
As RJio's growth slows, Jio Platforms Ltd, its holding company, is keen to replicate the success of Wireless in other business streams. With aggressive plans and product launches in place, Jio Platforms is creating multiple monetization opportunities in the Digital space.
Thus, we assign an EV/EBITDA multiple of 17x on FY23 EBITDA, maintaining target price of Rs 900/share (for its 66 per cent stake). The higher multiple captures digital revenue opportunity, potential tariff hikes, and opportunity in the Low-cost Device market, among others, not built into our estimates.
We roll forward the valuation on an FY23 basis, valuing Reliance Retail’s core business at 30x EV/EBITDA and assigning 4x to Connectivity, arriving at TP of Rs 645 – after excluding the recent 10 per cent stake sale. Our premium valuation multiples capture the opportunity for rapid expansion in the Retail business and the aggressive rollout of the JioMart platform.
Kotak Institutional Equities
TP: Rs 2,050 | Reco: Add
RIL's operating performance across segments was weaker than our expectations in 3QFY21. Debt reduction was lower as a significant portion of inflows from capital raise and cash profits was once again utilized in capex, working capital and repayment of creditors. Lesser disclosures could have been avoided. We expect the stock to remain muted as digital initiatives remain WIP with limited tangible details to appreciate the long-term narrative for now.
We cut FY2022-23E EPS by 6 per cent factoring in (1) lower downstream margins, (2) lower subscriber additions, (3) lower retail revenues and margins and (4) other minor changes. We raise FY2021E EPS though by 9 per cent reflecting positive variance in below-EBITDA items and negligible tax rate. Our SoTP-based FV reduces to Rs 2,050 from Rs 2,150 on lower estimates and higher debt.
Edelweiss Securities
TP: Rs 2,105 | Reco: Hold
Reliance Industries' Q3FY21 EBITDA of Rs 21,500 crore (down 4 per cent YoY) came in line with our estimate. PAT of Rs 13,100 crore beat estimate, but was entirely driven by investment
income and a near-zero tax liability. O2C & retail missed expectations, but RJio beat forecasts. While recovery is underway, it is mixed.
But, transparency levels are falling across businesses. RIL has stopped reporting a key matrix—GRM—altogether. Similarly, it has ceased providing division-wise turnover breakdown for retail and RJio's key driver FTTH lacks granularity. In our view, primary stock triggers—deleveraging, asset monetisation, digital momentum—have played out.
Retail PAT attributable to RIL is diluted by 10 per cent stake sale, resulting in estimated 7 per cent YoY PAT fall (standalone up 4 per cent). Similarly, on 33 per cent stake sale, attributable PAT growth dips to 63 per cent YoY for RJio versus standalone of 144 per cent. While consumer-facing, RJio and retail optically contribute to half of RIL’s EBITDA, it falls to only 29 per cent at attributable consolidated PAT level.
Prabhudas Lilladher
TP: Rs 2,232 | Reco: Buy
We leave our FY22/23E estimates unchanged, but increase FY21 estimates by 34 per cent to factor in deferred tax credit for restructuring of the O2C business and other changes in depreciation and finance charges. Recovering economic activity augurs well for all RIL’s business segments and downstream focus will create value going ahead. RIL with its stated intention to monetize and forge global partnership across businesses, is well positioned to incubate new business and pursue inorganic opportunities given its liquid BS. We believe positive news flow on global partnerships or stake sale is likely to keep valuations at elevated level. Maintain BUY with a PT of Rs 2,232 (unchanged).
HDFC Securities
TP: Rs 2,330 | Reco: Add
Our ADD rating on RIL with a price target of INR 2,330 /sh is premised on (1) induction of Facebook, Google, Intel and Qualcomm as partners in Jio Platforms, which should help the company accelerate the growth of digital connectivity and create value in the digital ecosystem through technology offerings, (2) recovery in refining and petchem businesses in FY22E, (3) the emergence of a clear path to a stronger balance sheet, and (4) stake sale in the retail business.
We have raised our FY21/22 EPS estimates by 22.0/11.5 per cent to Rs 69.9/91.5 per share, mainly to account a better-than-anticipated 9MFY21 performance, and a lower-than-expected tax outgo in FY21.
We use EV/EBITDA to value downstream at Dec-22E EV/e, Retail on peer benchmarked EV/e and E&P, Jio on DCF. The stock is currently trading at 12.2x Dec-22E EV/EBITDA and 22.4x Dec-22E EPS.
IDBI Capital
TP: Rs 2,475 | Reco: Buy
Reliance Industries (RIL) Q3FY21 result was below our estimates at operational level (in line with consensus) while PAT was higher than our and consensus estimates on the back of deferred tax reversal and lower interest cost.
Higher volume in O2C, robust polymer margin, higher ARPU and lower effective tax rate along with lower interest and higher other income swelled net profit. However, the company's new reporting structure (integrated refining and petrochem division to O2C business), led to non-disclosure of GRM. Lower crack spreads and weaker retail division (excl investment income) performance during Q3 was a disappointment.
With vaccination drive, we expect GRM to improve further led by pick-up in economic activity. We raise PAT estimates for FY21E by 16.6 per cent to factor in lower tax rate and lower interest outgo while keep other estimates largely unchanged. We slightly tweak our TP to Rs 2,475 from Rs 2,468."

The country's largest company by market capitalisation on January 22 reported a 40.5 percent sequential growth in consolidated profit at Rs 14,894 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, driven by a robust revival in O2C and retail segments and a steady growth in digital-services business, with Jio showing a 15.5 percent QoQ growth in profit and 4.1 percent rise in ARPU.
The oil-to-telecom conglomerate's profit in the previous quarter stood at Rs 10,602 crore.

Here is what brokerages have to say on the stock and the company after the December quarter numbers:
Prabhudas Lilladher
We leave our FY22/23E estimates unchanged but increase FY21 estimates by 34 percent to factor in deferred tax credit for the restructuring of the O2C business and other changes in depreciation and finance charges. Recovering economic activity augurs well for RIL’s all business segments and downstream focus will create value going ahead.
With its stated intention to monetise and forge global partnerships across businesses, RIL is well-positioned to incubate new businesses and pursue inorganic opportunities given its liquid BS. We believe positive news flow on global partnerships or stake sale is likely to keep valuations at an elevated level. Maintain a ""buy"" with a price target of 2,232 (unchanged).

RIL believes demand for PVC, PP and polyester is expected to remain firm on account of improving end-markets.
We believe the spike in the petchem margins is led by pent-up demand post-COVID. Moreover, huge capacity additions in China would further lead to pressure on petchem margins in the coming months.
RIL recently commissioned gas production from its R-series cluster. KG basin is expected to achieve peak production of ~30mmscmd over the next two years (v/s current production of ~ 4.5mmscmd.
Using SOTP, we value the refining and petrochemical segment at 7.5x FY23E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a valuation of Rs 780 a share for standalone. We ascribe an equity valuation of Rs 900 a share to RJio and Rs 645 a share to Reliance Retail. Reiterate ""buy"", with a target price of Rs 2,325 a share.
Sharekhan
We lower our FY2021 earnings estimate to factor weaker-than-expected standalone performance partially offset by a fall in interest costs. We have fine-tuned our FY2022-FY2023 earnings estimates. We expect RIL’s earnings momentum to improve from hereon, as downstream margin would recovery with the expectation of higher oil and petrochemical demand in CY2021.
Moreover, the recent start of gas production from the KG D-6 field (expected peak production of 30 mmscmd) is positive in terms of revival of the upstream business. Additionally, recent SEBI approval for the acquisition of Future Group’s retail business by Reliance Retail would fasten the deal process and ultimately help RIL to further consolidate its position in the organised retail space in the country.
Further value unlocking in the digital and retail businesses (with a likely IPO for the consumer business in the next few years) would add to shareholder’s return in coming years. Hence, we maintain our buy rating on RIL, with an unchanged SoTP-based price target of Rs 2,400. At CMP, the stock is trading at 19x its FY2023E EPS and 8.8x FY2023E EV/EBITDA.

The wealth of Indian billionaires grew 35 per cent during the lockdown and 90 per cent since 2009 to 422.9 billion dollars.
The Covid virus drew a greater divide between the rich and the poor. Statistically, an unskilled worker would take a whopping 10,000 years to make as much money as Reliance Industries’ Mukesh Ambani made in an hour during the pandemic. Further, it would take the same person three years to make what one of Asia’s richest men Mukesh Ambani made in a second, according to Oxfam’s latest report ‘The Inequality Virus’. Moreover, Mukesh Ambani’s pandemic earnings would keep the 40 crore informal workers, who are at risk of falling into poverty due to Covid, above the poverty line for at least five months.
Along with Mukesh Ambani, the tribe of overall 100 billionaires in India saw nearly Rs 13 lakh crore jump in wealth since March 2020, which is “enough to give every one of the 138 million (nearly 14 crore) poorest Indian people a cheque for Rs 94,045 each,” Oxfam said in the statement citing the report. While the report usually focused on the growing inequality between the rich and the poor in its past editions, this year it was Covid-centric.

China's economy is continuing steady recovery this year, vice premier Han Zheng says
While the likes of Kumar Manglam Birla, Uday Kotak, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Sunil Mittal, Shiv Nadar, Laxmi Mittal, Cyrus Poonawalla, and Radhakrishan Damani, became exponentially richer since March 2020 amid economic turmoil, 1.7 lakh people lost their jobs every hour in April 2020, as per the report’s findings.
According to Oxfam, figures on the richest people came from Forbes’ 2020 Billionaires List. The wealth of Indian billionaires grew 35 per cent during the lockdown and 90 per cent since 2009 to $422.9 billion. This ranked India sixth globally after the US, China, Germany, Russia, and France. The rise in wealth of Indian billionaires was so overwhelming that the top 11 billionaires of India during the pandemic could sustain the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme for 10 years or the health ministry for 10 years with their increased wealth.

“The report shows how the rigged economic system is enabling a super-rich elite to amass wealth in the middle of the worst recession and the biggest economic crisis in the history of independent India, while billions of people are struggling to make ends meet. It reveals how the pandemic is deepening long-standing economic, caste, ethnic, and gender divides,” said Amitabh Behar, CEO, Oxfam India in the statement.
While India had enforced one of the earliest and most stringent lockdowns following the pandemic to arrest the virus breakout, it had impacted the economy severely. It triggered unemployment, hunger, distress migration, and more. Amid the chaos, a majority of the people had lost their livelihood while the white-collar workers isolated themselves and continued working from home, according to Oxfam.
The findings noted that informal workers were worst hit as out of 122 million who lost their jobs, 75 per cent, which accounted for 92 million jobs, were lost in the informal sector. Also, more than 300 informal workers died due to starvation, suicides, exhaustion, road and rail accidents, police brutality, and denial of timely medical care. Oxfam said that the National Human Rights Commission had recorded more than 2582 cases of human rights violations as early as April 2020. “While the Coronavirus was being touted as a great equaliser in the beginning, it laid bare the stark inequalities inherent in the society soon after the lockdown was imposed,” Behar added.

Reliance spins off oil-to-chemical unit,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/reliance-spins-off-oil-to-chemical-unit,": Sunday, January 24, 2021, 8:19 PM IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd has completed spin-off of the firm's oil-to-chemical business into a new unit that will help it pursue growth opportunities with strategic partnerships, the company has said.
The oil-to-chemical (O2C) business unit holds Reliance's oil refinery and petrochemical assets and retail fuel business but not upstream oil and gas producing fields such as KG-D6 and textiles business.
X
Reliance for the first time reported integrated earnings of the O2C business in its third quarter financial results. Previously, refining and petrochemical businesses were reported separately while fuel retailing revenue was part of the firm's overall retail business.
In the October-December 2020 earnings statement, refining and petrochemical as well as fuel retailing businesses earnings were reported as one. As a result, it did not give refining margins - the most sought after number to assess the firm's oil refining business.
""Reorganising refining and petrochemicals as oil-to-chemicals (O2C) reflects new strategy as well as management matrix,"" the company said in a post earning investor presentation.
This, it said, will ""facilitate holistic and agile decision making"" as well as ""pursue attractive opportunities for growth with strategic partnerships"".
Reliance started work on hiving off the O2C business into a separate unit last year for a possible stake sale to companies such as Saudi Aramco.
It values the O2C business at USD 75 billion and has been in talks with Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) for sale of a 20 per cent interest.
The company, however, did not mention discussions with Aramco, which are said to have hit a valuation roadblock.
The reorganisation would ""drive the move towards further downstream and closer to customers"" and ""provide sustainable and affordable energy and materials solutions to meet India's growing needs,"" the firm said in the presentation.
Reliance O2C Limited houses oil refining and petrochemical plants and manufacturing assets, bulk and wholesale fuel marketing, and Reliance's 51 per cent interest in retail fuel joint venture with BP of the UK.
The O2C unit also houses the firm's Singapore and the UK-based oil trading subsidiaries and marketing subsidiary, Reliance Industries Uruguay Petroquimica SA.
It also houses Reliance Ethane Pipeline Limited that operates a pipeline between Dahej in Gujarat and Nagothane in Maharashtra as well as 74.9 per cent stake that Reliance holds in the joint venture with Sibur.
Its very large ethane carriers, gas pipelines such as one that transports coal-bed methane from its CBM blocks, overseas oil and gas asset holding company Reliance Industries (Middle East) DMCC, and domestic exploration and production assets would not form part of the O2C unit.
Also, Reliance's textiles business as operated out of the Naroda site, Baroda township and land, including cricket stadium, Jamnagar power assets, and Sikka Ports and Terminals Limited would also not be part of the O2C unit.
Ambani had in July 2019 stated that the process of spinning of O2C into a separate subsidiary would be completed by early 2021.
Reliance owns and operates twin oil refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.
It is also the country's largest petrochemical manufacturer with units at Jamnagar, Dahej, Hazira, Nagothane, Vadodara, Patalganga, Silvassa, Barabanki, and Hoshiarpur.
The company holds a 66.6 per cent stake in the KG-D6 block where it is investing about USD 5 billion in developing a second set of gas discoveries along with BP.
It also has a similar stake in the NEC-25 block in the Bay of Bengal and operates two CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh. These upstream assets are not part of the O2C unit.
""Reliance O2C (is) one of the most integrated manufacturers of value-added fuels, chemicals and materials,"" the presentation said. ""O2C to maximize downstream, reduce transportation fuels and create clean and green energy platforms."""

Zhong Shanshan, the richest
However, Zhong Shanshan, Chairman of the Chinese bottled-water company Nongfu Spring, continues to be the richest Asian with a networth of $100 billion, and ranks the sixth richest globally. Zhong with a networth of $93.8 billion as of January 8 had dethroned Ambani (with a networth of $88 billion then) to become the richest Asian, according to data collated by Hurun Research.
Hammered by a fall in share prices, Ambani’s wealth had fallen to $83 billion as of January 8 from $88 billion posted in September last year, pushing him down to the ninth position from eighth in December.
Ambani, who was ranked the ninth richest man in the global rich list for two consecutive years, 2019 and 2018, had even moved up to fourth place in August 2020.
 Riding on the BSE’s surge and a SEBI approval for a deal with Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, RIL’s share price moved up 2.09 per cent to close at ₹2,097.85 on Thursday. Earlier on September 16, 2020, the stock had breached the 52-week high of ₹2,368.80, while the 52-week low of ₹867.82 was recorded on March 23, 2020.
“The quick turnaround of the Indian stock market post lock-down indicates that Indian wealth creators have preserved and beaten the Covid-19 impact. For instance, an investment, at the right price, in the companies founded by top 100 in IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List would have registered almost 50 per cent year-on-year returns,” Hurun India Managing Director and Chief Researcher Anas Rahman Junaid said.
Global Top 10
Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk topped the charts with a wealth of $197 billion, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with a wealth of $191 billion, while Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates with a networth of $128 billion came in third.

On O2C basis, total throughput has increased from 16.8 MMT to 18.2 MMT on Q-o-Q basis due to improved product demand in Q3 and scheduled shutdown taken in Q2.

Media Business
The segment revenues recovered fully from the pandemic impact in Q3 FY21, rising sharply by 34% QoQ to Rs 1,422 crore. Festive season buoyancy and sustained elevation in media consumption largely eliminated the COVID-linked drag on ad-spending. Revenue of the primary business of broadcast and digital media (i.e ex-film production) grew 35% QoQ and 1% YoY, as a result of sustained viewership and faster than expected recovery in Ad revenues. EBITDA for Q3 FY21 grew 96% QoQ and 21% YoY to Rs 324 crore. EBITDA margins rose to about 23% as all three verticals(Entertainment, TV and Digital News) improved their profitability levels.

Reliance Industries Ltd.’s third-quarter profit and net revenue are expected to decline even as demand for petrochemical fuels rise and margin increases.
Consolidated net profit of India’s biggest company by market value is expected to decline 2.8% year-on-year to Rs 11,313 crore in the quarter ended December, according to the average of analyst estimates tracked by Bloomberg. Consolidated revenue is likely to fall 20.9% year-on-year to Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while operating income is estimated to slip 15.6%.
Apart from the increased demand for petrochemicals, a rebound in the retail arm is expected to help cushion parent’s financials. Reliance Industries is set to announce its third-quarter results on Friday.
The petrochemical segment is expected to support earnings as strong demand and weak supply led to an increase in the global petrochemical prices. Demand for polyvinyl chloride—used to make pipes, medical devices and cables—improved in the third quarter as several countries in Asia and the Middle East resumed work after emerging from lockdowns that were imposed to curb the Covid-19 pandemic.
Prices of polyethylene, with extensive usage in the packaging industry, rose because of supply disruption caused by U.S. hurricanes, while polypropylene prices are increasing as consumption of non-woven and film applications for food packaging and in the hygiene sector jumped.
Refining margin will improve only marginally amid a moderate pick-up in global demand for refined products. The cracks or margins on transport fuels like gasoline and diesel remained weak in the quarter ended December.
Prices of Brent crude—the Asian benchmark—rose 4.4% to $44.6 per barrel during the period.
Reliance Jio
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. added around 6 million subscribers in the quarter ended December and its average revenue per user rose 2.7% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 149 per month, according to estimates.
Analysts expect a weak revenue growth and cost inflation but are doubtful that the operator will push for tariff hikes.
Reliance Retail
Analysts expect an improvement in Reliance Retail Ltd.’s sales across categories even as margin will take time to recover. EBIT may jump significantly on a sequential basis, but will be down on a year-on-year basis.
Aggressive store addition and the recent JioMart-led online opportunity will provide strong growth potential going forward, they said.

Dalal Street Week Ahead: 10 key factors that will keep traders busy next week
We have collated views of experts on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on January 22:
Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities
Havells India: Trend deciding level Rs 1085
On Jan 21st the stock made yet another all-time high of 1147. The stock has already rallied by nearly 25 percent so far in January. The important point to note is that the stock not only surpassed its previous 52-week high of 855 but posted a breakout within a very short period of time as it rallied from 850 to 1147.
On the daily as well as weekly charts, the stock has formed a breakout continuation pattern which is grossly positive for Havells India.
However, in the short term time frame, the momentum indicators indicate that the stock is in an overbought zone and there are high chances of a quick short term price correction that can’t be ruled out if the stock trades below 1085.
For the next few trading sessions, 1085 should be the trend decider level for the bulls, and if it sustains above the same, then we can expect a continuation of the uptrend up to 1200.
Further, the uptrend may also continue which could lift the stock up to 1335. On the flip side, dismissal of 1085 could possibly trigger quick short term correction up to 1025-1000.
Voltas: 940 and 930 should be the sacrosanct levels
The stock has rallied over 5 percent on January 21st. On Thursday, the stock opened with a gap-up and quickly surpassed the 940 resistance mark with strong volume activity.
Despite tepid market conditions, Voltas maintained its strong momentum throughout the day. On the short term time frame, the stock has formed a strong price volume breakout pattern.
The texture of the pattern suggests that the breakout action will continue in the near term if the stock succeeds to trade above the 940 level.
For the swing traders, 940 and 930 should be the sacrosanct levels. We can expect the uptrend to continue up to 990-1020 if it trades above 930-940 levels.
Reliance Industries: Upside likely to continue
Post the medium-term correction, the stock was hovering between 1800 to 2000 price ranges.
After a long time on the weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong bullish candle along with modest volume activity that clearly suggests high chances of a fresh uptrend from the current level.
In addition, after a long time Reliance Industries managed to close above 100-Days SMA which is broadly positive and the texture of the chart suggests that the uptrend will continue if it succeeds to trade above the same.
For the trend following traders 2050 -2025 should be the key level to watch. Above the same uptrend wave expected till 2150. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock up to 2225.
Note: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.
Expert: Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities
Britannia Industries: Buy| Target: Rs 4050
The stock is trending above its 200-day average and we expect a strong breakout from the current levels. The RSI has moved higher from its lower range.
The risk-reward appears to be favorable at the current levels. In case of any decline, the stock will find strong support at around Rs3,245 which could be the Stop Loss.
Muthoot Finance: Buy| Target: Rs 1325
The stock has completed its corrective action from the recent high of 1405 levels and holding its band of averages. The daily RSI is trading above the lower band and confirms for a reversal from current levels
There are multiple support levels in the range of 1130-1140 levels that would be protected. A stop-loss can be placed below Rs 1115.
SBI Life: Buy| Target: Rs 1025
Over the past few months, the stock has been making higher tops and higher bottoms on weekly charts. Recently, the stock has witnessed minor pullback near to its short-term averages from the recent high.
This gives an opportunity to add longs, as the stock is expected to scale all-time high over the next few weeks. In case of decline, the 200-day average (which is placed at Rs818) would act as reversal point (Stop Loss) on closing basis.

Going into the trade today, benchmark indices could slip further following weak cues from Asian peers. Meanwhile, stock-specific cues and Q3 earnings will also guide market mood. At 7.10 am, SGX Nifty was trading 35 points lower at 14,608.
In the overnight session, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs, up 0.03% and 0.55%, respectively, propelled by optimism about more pandemic relief under the Biden administration. Dow was also poised for a record until falling into negative territory in the final minutes of trading and shed 0.04%.
Asian markets, however, pulled back from an all-time high as investors assessed earnings, prospects for stimulus and escalating coronavirus cases.
Japan’s Topix index slipped 0.6%, South Korea’s Kospi added 0.1% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.1%.
That apart, cryptocurrency bitcoin extended its slide and fell to an almost three-week low on profit-taking and worries about extra regulation. Bitcoin fell nearly 5% to $29,300 early in the Asia session, its lowest since Jan. 4 and some 30% below its record high of $42,000 hit two weeks ago.
Now, a look at the stock-specific developments that are likely to sway the market today:
Reliance Industries, Yes Bank, Gland Pharma, JSW Steel, Oberoi Realty and V-Mart Retail are among 41 companies set to announce their quarterly earnings later today.
Driven by a strong rebound in petrochemicals business, and supported by growth in the retail segment, RIL is expected to clock a stellar sequential improvement in its net profit for the December quarter of the current financial year (Q3FY21).
SBI Cards and Payment Services reported nearly 52 per cent dip in its net profit to Rs 210 crore in the third quarter ended December 2020, on higher provisioning.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) share price surged over 3 per cent to Rs 2,119.80 apiece in a strong trade on BSE today. While shares of Future Retail Ltd and Future Enterprises Ltd hit their respective 5 per cent upper circuit of Rs 81.35 apiece and Rs 12.01 apiece, respectively. This surge in share prices was seen after the capital market regulator SEBI approved the Future Group’s proposed multi-billion dollar deal with RIL.

Moreover, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) also granted its ‘no adverse observation’ report to the Rs 24,713-crore deal.

“Company shall ensure that the shares of the transferee entity issued in lieu of the locked-in shares of the transferor entities are subjected to lock-in for the remaining period post scheme,” Sebi said. It also added that it was observed that there were certain ongoing litigations/arbitration/legal proceedings against the draft scheme.

"Rebound in petchem, retail business to drive RIL Q3; JioMart road map eyed",Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/rebound-in-petchem-retail-business-to-drive-ril-q3-jiomart-road-map-eyed-121012000691_1.html,"Last Updated at January 20, 2021 14:46 IST","Driven by a strong rebound in petrochemicals business, and supported by growth in the retail segment, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to clock a stellar sequential improvement in its net profit for the December quarter of the current financial year (Q3FY21). The firm is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings on Friday, January 22.
Analysts are penciling-in up to 32 per cent sequential growth in RIL’s consolidated net profit, pegged at Rs 12,600 crore, against a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 9,567 crore reported in the September quarter of FY21 (Q2FY21).
“Sharply lower interest costs and a continued decline in the tax rate should drive around 32 per cent increase in attributable PAT on a quarterly basis. As regards the pre-tax profit, it should still be down year-on-year, given a sharply lower consolidated tax rate,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a result preview report. RIL’s profit before tax (PBT) and net profit in the year-ago period stood at Rs 15,082 crore and Rs 11,640 crore, respectively.
Those at BofA Securities, however, remain mildly cautious in their estimate and peg the net profit at Rs 11,100 crore for the quarter.
“We expect RIL to show a 16 per cent QoQ increase in PAT led by improving oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business, a strong continued momentum in retail, and steady Jio. The net income increase is further aided by a 20 per cent sequential decline in finance expenses due to cash coming in Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail from Google and financial investors, respectively,” they noted.
Since April 2020, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani has sold nearly 33 per cent in Jio Platforms to global marquee investors, bringing a cash inflow of around $20 billion (Rs 1.52 trillion). Meanwhile, nearly 10 per cent stake sale in Reliance Retail towards the end of 2020 resulted in another $6.4 billion (Rs 47,300 crore) of inflow for RIL.
Operationally, Goldman Sachs foresees Reliance’s consolidated core Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) to grow 13 per cent over the September quarter to around Rs 21,408 crore. This would, however, be a 5 per cent decline year-on-year. Ebitda in Q2FY21 and Q3FY20 were Rs 18,945 crore and Rs 22,386 crore, respectively.
Back home, Edelweiss Securities expects a strong petchem Ebitda of over 15.7 per cent quarter of quarter (QoQ), refining Ebitda of 13 per cent QoQ, and retail Ebitda of 34 per cent QoQ will be partly offset by a modest telecom Ebitda of 5.6 per cent QoQ, leading to an 8.3 per cent QoQ increase in consolidated Ebitda to Rs 20,522 crore.
Segment-wise analysis
O2C business
BofA expects overall O2C Ebit to be up 14 per cent QoQ, led by a steady momentum at the Petchem business. Further, they expect refinery Ebit to be largely flattish and modest improvement in gross refining margins (GRMs).
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs pegs GRM, which measures the earnings from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, at $6.5 per bbl, up $0.8/bbl QoQ from $5.7 per bbl, supplementing the recovery in refining utilisation/volume. The brokerage further forecasts 16 million tonnes in throughput over the third quarter compared with 15 million tonnes in the second.
A conservative estimate by Edelweiss Securities, however, pegs GRM at $5.8/bbl (down 37 per cent YoY from $9.2 per bbl) on the back of weaker cracks across distillates. “Petchem margin may increase YoY due to higher polyster and polymer spreads and with moderate demand leads to an increase in petchem Ebitda,” it added.
Retail
A rebound in footfall in retail store, due to the festive season may drive core retail revenues up 47 per cent QoQ, and 10 per cent YoY, says Goldman Sachs. “We expect positive growth for grocery, while fashion and electronics will remain flattish YoY. We expect core Ebitda to grow 31 per cent QoQ at 12 per cent below last year’s levels,” it added.
BofA analysts, on the other hand, expect operational leverage to help in Ebitda margins by 92 bps to 5.8 per cent, leading to overall Ebit growth of 38 per cent QoQ. Retail Ebit stood at Rs 2,389 crore in the year-ago quarter, while it was Rs 1,522 crore in Q2FY21.
Telecom
Jio’s Ebitda, analysts say, is expected to remain stable on account of decent subscriber additions (about nearly 10 million in Q3), and higher Arpu (Rs 145).
“We look for improving subs mix to help in 1.8 per cent QoQ improvement in implied average revenue per user (ARPU). Overall, we expect Jio to report 3.6 per cent sequential revenue increase. We expect Ebitda margin to improve by 14 bps QoQ to 43.7 per cent, led by continued revenue growth,” note BofA report.
Stock performance
RIL shares have pulled back 17 per cent since mid-September 2020 and have underperformed the Nifty by 41 per cent. Goldman Sachs believes continued sequential earnings recovery along with catalysts around telecom tariff hikes, new product launches (non-grocery e-commerce, for example), and a potential energy business stake sale can reverse this underperformance.
On similar lines, JPMorgan would focus on the management’s commentary on Jio, and Jio Mart rollout."

Bajaj Finance, followed by SBI, ONGC, IndusInd Bank, Reliance Industries, HDFC and Axis Bank were among the top gainers. On the other hand, ITC and HDFC Bank were the laggards.
 Here's a look at five factors that brought indices near record highs today.
1. Global markets
Benchmark indices extended gains in afternoon trade, buoyed by positive Asian and European markets. Shares climbed overseas on Tuesday as the coming changing of the guard in the US raised hopes for more support for the economy. Market participants also awaited remarks from the nominee for Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen's speech, scheduled later today Investors were also enthused with the US President-elect Joe Biden taking office tomorrow.
Asian shares climbed on Tuesday as investors were enthused after data out on Monday showed that China's economy actually picked up speed as the year closed. The world's second-largest economy was one of the few to grow over 2020. Australian shares also climbed almost 2% as investors bet on news that Queensland state was set to lift virus-led restrictions.
On Wall Street, futures also looked a little steadier as S&P 500 added 0.67% and NASDAQ futures 0.97%. US markets were shut yesterday for Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
European markets closed slightly higher led by auto stocks. Rising coronavirus cases and vaccination continued to dominate headlines.
Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said,""The major positive development for markets today is the Treasury Secretary-elect Janet Yellen's comment on the need for 'big stimulus'. Further big stimulus along with the huge liquidity created by the unprecedented monetary stimulus can keep markets buoyant.""
2. FII inflows
Despite the weakness in the last two sessions, foreign institutional investors (FII) have not stopped buying domestic securities. As per experts, the trend is likely to continue on the back of positive earnings ahead of Budget. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth Rs 650.60 crore in the Indian equity market on 18 January, provisional data showed.
Overall, in 2020, FIIs made a net equity investment of Rs 1.5 lakh crore into the Indian market, as per data available with NSE. This is when most Asian and emerging markets witnessed outflows. Till January 20, 2021, FIIs have pumped Rs 16,901 crore into the equity market, amid rising hopes for strong economic recovery and significant decline in domestic COVID-19 cases compared to western countries, especially US and European nations. Weakness in dollar index and steady currency also supported inflows.
3. Hopes from Budget 2021
The sharp fall in the last two trading days indicated profit-booking by the investors ahead of the Union Budget. Gains in large caps such as Reliance Industries, HDFC and Infosys today suggested that investors were betting on quality stocks ahead of Budget 2021, scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2021.
Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said, ""There'll be no shortage of trading and investment opportunities, thanks to prevailing earnings season and the upcoming budget. Amid all, we suggest not to go overboard and stick to the quality names and accumulate them on dips.""
4. Q3 earnings
The focus of market has shifted to third-quarter earnings, cheered by better-than-expected performance by most corporates. September quarterly earnings announcements from yesterday also helped in pushing the market upwards.
Due to the ongoing earnings season, there's a rise in volatility on the domestic front. With most December quarter earnings being decent so far, investors are betting on quality stocks. Decreasing COVID-19 cases and the beginning of the vaccine drive are also positive factors.
As per market participants, the bullish rally may extend to all-time highs as excitement is likely to continue till the Budget.
Today, industry majors like ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company, Alembic Pharma, CEAT, CSB Bank, DCM Shriram, L&T Infotech, Tata Communications, Tata Metaliks, Tata Steel among others will report Q3 earnings, which will also set the tone for the stock market tomorrow.
5. Technical outlook
Equity index Nifty 50 today opened with a gap up after two days of slump, with heavy buying sentiment in index heavyweights like RIL, HDFC, Bajaj twins, SBI, ONGC. Due to consecutive decline in the index for the past 2 days, major technical indicators on the near-term timeframe chart tested their oversold zone. On the higher side, NSE Nifty 50 crossed the major hurdle at around 14,500-level. As per analysts, Nifty has resistance around the 14550-14600 levels.
As per traders, valuations of major stocks have also cooled off after two days of slump and investors picked up performance majors ahead of the budget.
Today, market breadth also favoured advances, with the advance-decline ratio at 3:1. All sectoral indices closed in green territory, with metal, media, financials and banking index closing over 2% each. Meanwhile, the volatility index fell over 6% today.
Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical at CapitalVia Global Research Limited said,"" Market is aligned to be in a range-bound movement between the levels of 14180-14680. Our research suggests, a decisive breakout above the zone of 14680-14700 could lead to an improvement in market breadth, and a rally till the levels of 14850-14870.""
""Going ahead, 14450 and 14320 would now be seen as immediate supports, whereas 14600-14620 would be the immediate range to watch,"" said Ruchit Jain (Senior Analyst - Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking.

It serves as a highly accurate indicator of the business's potential profitability because it excludes all extra factors.

We considered only companies where FIIs and MFs, both, increased stake in the first two quarters of FY21. Interestingly, in FY21 so far, all of them have been trading in the green and have gained between 20 percent and 190 percent. (Data Source: ACE Equity)

The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index fell 1.06% to close at 14,281.3, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.96% at 48,564.27. Both indexes touched their lowest closing level since Jan. 7.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to set out proposals this week where it may recommend that bigger shadow banks maintain a statutory liquidity ratio and a cash reserve ratio, which could be a huge cash drain for the sector, Reuters reported on Saturday.
""Any such strict regulations, if implemented at a time when economic growth is very weak, could severely constrain ability of NBFCs to lend and further jeopardise growth,"" Macquarie analyst Suresh Ganapathy said in a note to clients.
The RBI has been trying to tighten regulatory norms for the sector after the collapse of India's largest shadow lender IL&FS in 2018, as the sector also recovers from a coronavirus-led slowdown.
Shares of the country's largest mortgage lender HDFC fell 2.5%, while Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv dropped over 3%.
The Nifty Metal Index was the worst performing index, falling 4.1% to its lowest since Jan. 4.
HDFC Bank ended up 1.1% at a record closing high, after the top private-sector lender on Saturday reported strong profit and loan growth for the December quarter.
India's most valuable company Reliance Industries advanced 2.4%. The conglomerate plans to embed its ecommerce app JioMart into WhatsApp within six months, financial daily Mint reported.
Dewan Housing Finance Corp rose 5% after the company's creditors voted for a 372.5 billion rupee ($5.09 billion) takeover bid by the Piramal Group for the troubled shadow lender.

E-retailers must scale up to become profitable,Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/e-retailers-must-scale-up-to-become-profitable/2172705/,"January 18, 2021 5:05 AM","Nonetheless, the market is getting competitive as players like Reliance Industries scale up and new entrants like the Tata Group come in.
As experts point out, it’s not as though the business models are in themselves unviable, it’s merely that companies continue to invest in acquiring customers.
While e-retailing continued to gain momentum in 2019-20, most players reported losses for the year. For a clutch of e-commerce companies — Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm, Zomato, PhonePe, Amazon Pay and First Cry – losses rose to Rs 17,617.15 crore from Rs 16,747 crore in 2018-19. Combined revenues, however, grew at a brisk pace, increasing by over 40% to around Rs 26,384 crore.
As experts point out, it’s not as though the business models are in themselves unviable, it’s merely that companies continue to invest in acquiring customers. “It is not so much of a unit economics challenge for some of the scaled-up players,” observes Arpit Mathur, partner, Kearney. Mathur explains it is about what is the pace at which they want to continue to acquire new customers because that is the key determinant of their overall profitability. He believes that attaining profitability in the next 18-24 months should not be a challenge because on a per transaction basis, the companies can still make money.

Of course, companies are taking a closer look at costs and losses, as Ankur Pahwa, partner at EY, observes. Discounts are smaller, procurement is more efficient and many are charging for delivery. Pahwa points out several players are rolling out private labels, which then helps improves their gross profits.
Nonetheless, the market is getting competitive as players like Reliance Industries scale up and new entrants like the Tata Group come in. To be able to grow their catchments, e-retailers will work on strategies to reach out to the next lot of potential customers. Today there are an estimated 200 million online shoppers whereas close to 600 million use mobile broadband services. While lockdowns have given online shopping a push, e-retailers would need to work hard to get more people to transact on the Internet. Kearney’s Mathur believes it may take more than just regular discounts and prompt deliveries. “There could be some behavioural reasons for more people not going online, it is not only about affordability,” he said, adding companies will need to do something different.
The omni-channel route is likely to be used to grow the user base signalling more partnerships between online and offline companies. Already, RIL is picking up stakes in online firms Urban Ladder, Netmeds or partnering with kiranas to fulfill orders for JioMart. The Tatas for instance are understood to be nearing a deal to buy a stake in BigBasket while ed-tech firm Byju’s is reportedly looking to acquire Aakash Educational Services.
With capital likely to remain abundant, as new investors look to bet on the India Internet story, Pahwa believes e-retailers are likely to continue to spend on acquiring customers. Indeed, Mathur estimates we could have as many as 350 million online customers by 2024.

HOMEMARKETSBenchmarks Attain Record Closing Highs On Thursday"
TCS market capitalisation touches all-time high of Rs 12 trillion,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/tcs-market-capitalisation-hits-all-time-high-of-rs-12-2-trillion-121011401441_1.html,"Last Updated at January 15, 2021 00:27 IST","The market capitalisation (m-cap) of TCS on Thursday topped the Rs 12-trillion-mark for the first time.
Shares of the Tata group flagship closed at a record high of Rs 3,250.15, up 2.9 per cent, valuing the company at Rs 12.02 trillion.
TCS is India’s second-most valuable firm after Reliance Industries (RIL), which has an m-cap of nearly Rs 12.9 trillion (including m-cap of partly-paid up shares).
The IT services firm staged a solid comeback in Q2, and growth momentum continued in Q3 as the firm beat Street estimates on all key parameters such as revenue, margin and profits.
Investors are cheering the stock after it signalled a return to the double-digit growth trajectory in the next financial year, on the back of a ramp-up in large contracts and a strong order pipeline. It had last achieved double-digit growth on a year-on-year (YoY) basis in June 2019.
TCS’s 7.2 per cent YoY growth in net profit to Rs 8,701 crore came in Q3, which is seasonally weak for Indian IT companies. Growth in all key segments and geographies helped the company achieve the result. TCS said this was its best Q3 performance in nine years.

Operating profit margins in the December quarter stood at 26.6 per cent — a rise of 160 per cent YoY, and were ahead of market expectations.
Brokerages have revised the profitability estimate for TCS, on the back of the third quarter beat.
CLSA increased its FY22 and FY23 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 4 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, and target price from Rs 3,070 to Rs 3,200, maintaining an ‘outperform’ rating.
Emkay Global has raised its FY21, FY22 and FY23 earnings estimates by 2.8 per cent, 4 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively, factoring in the Q3 beat.

“We believe TCS is poised to benefit from the acceleration in Cloud adoption and digital transformation opportunities, considering its end-to-end capabilities. However, valuations are rich. Maintain ‘hold’, with a target price of Rs 3,150 (earlier Rs 3,000) at 26x FY23E earnings,” Emkay Global said in its review.

Sentiment towards Indian IT stocks has improved, with the companies benefitting from a pick-up in demand, advancement of digital transformation by clients, as well as increased deal wins.
Other brokerages have also raised their target prices. The average target price of 39 analysts, polled by Bloomberg, following the results announcement, now stands at Rs 3,320 per share.
TCS and RIL have been playing cat-and-mouse for quite some time, in terms of claiming top spot for India’s most valuable company (see chart).
However, between April and October 2020, RIL shares galloped after the company’s successful mega fund raising — the largest by any Indian corporate — wherein it sold stakes in its digital (Jio) and retail arms, and also issued shares through a rights issue (Rs 53,000 crore) to shareholders, aggregating over Rs 2 trillion.

While the stake sales helped investors arrive at market-driven valuations for the firm’s consumer businesses, the uncertain growth environment due to the pandemic saw increased demand for stocks such as RIL, which are perceived to be safe havens.
Since October, with reducing uncertainty over economic growth and earnings, RIL has underperformed the benchmarks, while TCS has gained on an improved business outlook.
Consequently, the gap between the two has narrowed. TCS is now about Rs 85,800 crore behind RIL in market value."

The country aims to increase the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030 from the current level of about 6%.
Domestic natural gas production fell 11.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 27,642 million metric standard cubic metre (mmscm) in 2020 as operations became increasingly unviable for energy production companies with government lowering selling prices.
The 2,426 mmscm of natural gas produced in December was however the highest monthly output recorded in the ongoing fiscal, with the commencement of production from Reliance Industries (RIL) and BP’s ultra-deep-water field in the KG D6 Block of the Krishna Godavari basin on the east coast of India.

Demand for the natural gas in the domestic market is traditionally dependent on the fertiliser (28%), power (23%), city gas distribution entities (16%), refineries (12%) and petrochemicals industries (8%). However, due to lower cars running during the coronavirus lockdowns, CGD consumption has been less than refineries in the current financial year. Domestic natural gas output fell 2.8% y-o-y to 31,168.4 mmscm in FY20, reversing the growth trend recorded since FY18.
Domestic production has been falling with the ageing of existing fields and muted response from the industry to take up new projects, mainly due to lack of adequate incentives. Other reasons for lower output in FY20, as admitted by the government to a parliamentary committee, include lack of buyers, inadequate evacuation infrastructure and other technical constraints in hostile geographical terrains. The country aims to increase the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030 from the current level of about 6%.
As noted earlier by Care Ratings, the gross production of domestic natural gas will fall 10.6% during FY21 as “no company would aggressively want to increase production or get into high-risk projects with such a low gas price”. The current price for gas produced from local fields has been revised to an all-time low of $1.79/mmBtu by the government, which is much below the break-even point for most fields, the agency pointed. However, price of gas from ultra-deep-water gas fields is capped at a much higher rate of $4.06/mmBtu.
RIL and BP are jointly developing three gas fields in the KG D6 block entailing an investment of around Rs 35,000 crore, which are expected to cumulatively produce 30 mscmd by 2023, accounting for a quarter of the country’s domestic gas output.

Delhi HC admits Amazon plea against Future Retail,The Hindu Businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/delhi-hc-admits-amazon-plea-against-future-retail/article33570201.ece,"January 13, 2021","The Delhi High Court admitted Amazon’s plea against Future Retail on Wednesday and will hear the case on February 12. The two-judge bench maintained that the FRL-Reliance Industries Limited deal was maintainable, and the decision was to be taken by SEBI on the same.
However, the bench has also directed the Kishore Biyani-owned Future Retail to file a response in the matter of Amazon challenging prima facie observations, by a single judge, in Amazon’s attempt to control FRL was violative of FEMA and FDI rules.

The bench, consisting of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh heard the appeal and maintained that whether to pass the Future Retail-Reliance deal remains in the hands of SEBI. FRL has to respond to the prima facie observations made by Justice Mukta Gupta on December 21.
“Under Indian law, when there is an arbitration agreement between the parties, disputes arising under the contract have to be settled through arbitration. If parties have prescribed institutional arbitration, it will be decided under the aegis of that institution. If a party raises a dispute which is arbitrable, then under Section 8 of the Act, on an application, the court has the power to refer the subject to arbitration and can play a supportive and facultative role, in line with the contractually agreed dispute resolution mechanism,” said Gopal Jain, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India. “The High Court agreeing to hear the matter is a positive step for the Indian Arbitration Act. The ruling in this matter will play a role in enforcing belief in arbitration as a chosen mode of redressal,” said K Narasimhan, Advocate, Madras High Court.

Amazon, in its appeal, sought clarity on these observations as they have a bearing on its case in arbitration proceedings initiated before Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
It has further said that the observations are inconsistent with the findings in the SIAC emergency arbitral order of Oct. 25, 2020 against FRL’s asset sale under a Rs ₹24,713 crore deal with Reliance.
Earlier this month, BusinessLine had reported that in a letter addressed to Amazon, the Future Group has told Amazon that it is not liable to pay any compensation as there has been no breach of contract. The person said that this appeal could be a response to this letter in order to seek compensations from the Kishore Biyani-led company."
"Sensex closes 25 points lower as HDFC twins, Reliance Industries drag markets",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-closes-25-points-lower-dragged-by-hdfc-twins-reliance-industries/articleshow/80250792.cms,"Last Updated: Jan 13, 2021, 05:31 PM IST","NEW DELHI: A late selloff in HDFC twins and Reliance Industries dragged benchmark indices on Wednesday as they closed flat amid mixed domestic cues. Positive global cues kept losses in check.

Consistent foreign inflows along with better quarterly results are continuing to set the pace of the broad market. Analysts expect Q3 earnings to be better than the previous quarter, on the back of swifter recovery.

The 30-share pack Sensex dipped 24.79 points or 0.05 per cent to 49,492.32. Its broader peer, NSE Nifty, however, closed up 1.40 point or 0.01 per cent.

""Following positive global cues and ease in inflation for the month of December, the market opened with good gains. However, selling in heavyweights due to 1.9 per cent contraction in factory output, as per IIP data, knocked down the gains in the main benchmark while the broader market followed the positive trend,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Market at a glance:

Tata Motors continues to gain, rises 23 per cent in three days
Bharti Airtel gains 2 per cent after company gets nod for 100 per cent FDI limit
Nifty PSU Bank continues to gain, surges over 3 per cent
India VIX adds 2 per cent, reflecting growing nervousness among traders
320 stocks hit 52-wk highs: MRF, Tata Power, M&M, Maruti, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and DLF top names

Among the bluechip names, Mahindra & Mahindra was the top gainer, rising 5.66 per cent. SBI, Adani Ports, Indian Oil, NTPC, ITC, BPCL, Tata Steel, Grasim Industries and Tata Motors were other major gainers.

Losers among Nifty constituents were led by Bajaj Finance, which fell 2.94 per cent. Shree Cement, HDFC, UPL, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Divi’s Labs and Titan were other counters that ended in the red.

Broader market indices closed with cuts underperforming their headline peers. Nifty Smallcap dipped 0.18 per cent and Nifty Midcap fell 0.60 per cent. Nifty 500 -- the broadest index on NSE -- slid 0.14 per cent.

HUDCO, L&T Tech Services, Tata Chemicals, Aegis Chemicals, Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Moil were the top gainers from mid and smallcap indices, climbing in the range of 4-9 per cent.

Vakrangee, KEC International, Rashtriya Chemicals, Varun Beverages, Shriram Transport Finance and Chola Finance were major losers from the broader market space, falling in the range of 3-5 per cent.

Sectoral matrix was mixed on NSE. Nifty Pharma was the top loser, down 0.92 per cent, followed by Nifty Financial Service and Nifty Realty also dipped. Meanwhile, Nifty PSU Bank surged 3.27 per cent while Nifty Auto rose 0.88 per cent.

""We expect stock-specific volatility to remain high on account of earnings announcement so participants should prefer hedged positions instead of outrights.""
— Ajit Mishra, Religare Broking

Market breadth was in favour of losers as 1,236 stocks ended in the green, while 1,828 names settled with cuts. As many as 321 securities hit 52-week highs, mostly from the smallcap space. Meanwhile, 44 names hit 52-week lows, mostly from the microcap space. About 365 stocks hit upper circuit limits and 283 lower circuit limits.

European markets were trading higher at the last count. London-based FTSE was up 0.03 per cent while Paris and Frankfurt added 0.23 per cent and 0.02 per cent. In Asia, markets in Hong Kong and China closed in the red while others registered gains.

The benchmark Sensex ended the session at 49,517, a gain of 247 points or 0.5 per cent. The Nifty rose 78 points or 0.5 per cent to end the session at 14,563.
The markets fell initially after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mentioned the disconnect between the economy and the stock markets. The central bank said this poses risks to the country’s financial stability. RBI made these observations in its financial stability report published on Monday and warned of doubling of non-performing assets by September 2021.
However, the gain in the index heavyweights saved the day. The continuing optimism regarding the positive start to the earnings season and the imminent roll-out of Covid-19 vaccination in India also cheered investors, who are betting that this will accelerate economic recovery.
“A majority of sectors traded in the green in anticipation of good quarterly result, while pharma and FMCG experienced some selling. US bond yields have changed trajectory to a rising trend, which could impact emerging markets (EMs) in the future. But foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows are strong and the dollar continues to be weak due to oversupply, led by the high amount of fiscal stimulus,” said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services.
The mood in global markets was somewhat mixed as investors weighed the consequences of the rise in treasury yields and elevated valuations. Concerns persist about markets reaching highs when economic activity has been disrupted.

“Markets will react to the macroeconomic data in early trade on Wednesday. Further, earnings announcements from IT majors such as Infosys and Wipro will be on participants’ radar. We advise participants to align their positions according to the trend, but strictly avoid overleveraging at current levels,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president (research), Religare Broking.
On Tuesday, 387 stocks hit their 52-week highs, and 419 were locked in the upper circuit on the Sensex. Market breadth was positive with total advancing stocks at 1,664 and those declining at 1,435.
Half the Sensex components ended with gains.
SBI was the best-performing stock; Airtel and RIL rose 3.4 and 3.14 per cent, respectively.
Telecom and realty stocks rose the most, and their gauges rose 2.85 per cent and 2.84 per cent, respectively.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 571 crore, and domestic institutional investors sold shares worth Rs 1,334 crore.
M-cap of BSE-listed firms at fresh high
The market capitalisation (m-cap) of all BSE-listed entities jumped to an all-time high of Rs 197.46 trillion on Tuesday, driven by the bullish market sentiment. At the close of trade, the m-cap of all BSE-listed firms stood at Rs 1,97,46,939.57 crore ($2.6 trillion).
“Domestic equities remained firm, recovering sharply from the day’s low and recorded fresh highs. We believe fundamentals of the market remain intact considering sustained rebound in economic activity,” said Binod Modi, head of strategy at Reliance Securities. PTI"

On the other hand, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank, Titan, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra and HDFC were among the top losers.
In a volatile trading session, Sensex traded 80 points lower at 48,093 and Nifty fell by 8 points to 14,137 earlier at the opening bell. Yesterday, Sensex ended 486 points higher at 49,269 and Nifty gained 137 points to 14,484.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""The pace of the market rally continued despite RBI's caution over elevated NPA levels in 2021, supported by PSU Banks and Auto stocks.  Majority of the sectors traded in the green in anticipation of good quarterly result while pharma and FMCG experienced some selling. US bond yield has changed its trajectory to a rising trend, which could impact EMs in the future. But FII inflows are strong and the dollar continues to be weak due to oversupply of USD led by the high amount of fiscal stimulus.""
Global markets came off the record highs and traded steady this morning after shares on Wall Street pulled back overnight from all-time highs.
US stocks fell on Monday as investors assessed equity valuations and the outlook for more Covid-19 relief stimulus, along with ongoing political turmoil.
Tensions were high in Washington again to start the week as House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment on Monday against President Donald Trump for inciting the mob attack at the Capitol. The lower chamber plans to vote on the article sometime this week. Multiple Cabinet-level officials have quit since the riot, with President-elect Joe Biden set to be inaugurated on January 20.
European markets were also trading lower as rising coronavirus cases in many EU countries weighed as vaccination drive accelerates.
Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said,""Nifty suffered mild loss but managed to hold its bullish stream and decisively cross 14500 zone which was a good hurdle in nifty and managed to close a day at 14563 with gains of half a per cent. Going ahead 14500 will act as fantastic support in nifty and holding above said levels we may see some more decisive move in nifty towards 14600-14700 zone. The nifty bank has witnessed a bullish flag breakout on the two-hour chart which suggest nifty bank can outperform and see next move towards 32500-32700 zone.""
Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said,""After a tepid opening, the bulls were back in charge led by positive global cues and healthy buying interest in banking stocks. The Nifty index ended with healthy gains of 0.6% at 14,563 levels. The broader markets too ended with decent gains of 0.4% and 0.3% respectively. On the sector front, Telecom, Auto and Oil & Gas were the top gainers whereas Consumer Durables and Healthcare ended with losses.
Markets will react to the macroeconomic data (IIP & CPI) in early trade on Wednesday. Further, earnings announcements from select IT majors such as Infosys and Wipro would also remain on the participants' radar. We advise participants to align their positions according to the trend but strictly avoid overleveraging at current levels.""
On the currency front, Indian rupee, the domestic currency recouped yesterday's losses and closed 15 paise higher at 73.25, supported by weakness in the greenback overseas and recovery in domestic equities.
Sugandha Sachdeva VP-Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Broking said,"" We are witnessing a reversal in the dollar index, while political stability in the U.S. and the probability of a further fiscal stimulus package has pushed the long-term U.S. yields higher. Moreover, there is a possibility that the Fed may reduce its bond-buying plan towards the end of this year, which could further push U.S. yields higher and consequently hurt the rupee. Back home, with RBI mopping up dollar inflows, the local currency can test 73.80 to 74 levels in the coming sessions. We expect the rupee to trade in a broad range of 73 to 74.20 levels for the rest of this month.""

According to reports, Amazon.com Inc has filed an appeal in an ongoing dispute against local partner Future Group's plan to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries.

“The company is in receipt of the communication dated January 11, 2021, from lawyers of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC informing that Amazon has filed an appeal before Hon’ble Delhi High Court against the order dated December 21, 2020 passed by Ms. Justice Mukta Gupta (under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC) in Suit filed by the Company in Delhi High Court bearing reference no. CS (COMM) 493/2020.

We shall defend the Appeal through our legal counsels and keep you informed about outcome of the same,” company said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

Future Group, which operates supermarkets and high-end food stores across India, agreed to sell its retail assets to oil-to-clothes conglomerate Reliance in August for $3.4 billion but Amazon has alleged the deal breached agreements Future had made with the U.S. company in 2019.

Amazon also took Future Group to a Singapore arbitrator, which passed an interim order in October saying the Reliance deal should be halted. Future Retail has maintained that order is not binding and has instead mounted another legal challenge in a New Delhi court.

At around 9.40 am, Future Retail Ltd was trading at Rs74.95 per piece down by Rs0.95 or 1.25% on the BSE."

Facebook came in fifth with a networth of $816 billion, followed by Tencent Holdings ($715 billion), Alibaba ($712 billion) and Berkshire Hathaway $548 billion, according to the ranking, a list of 500 most valuable non-state-controlled companies in the world.
The ranking, released in association with China luxury tea brand Empereur, is based on value, defined as market capitalisation for listed companies and valuations for non-listed companies. The cut-off date was December 1, 2020.
The total value of Hurun Global 500 companies hit $50 trillion, equivalent to combined GDPs of world’s six largest economies (the US, China, Japan, Germany, India and the UK). Despite Covid-19, Hurun Global 500 rose by 25 per cent to an average of $99.3 billion, with 60 companies doubling in value terms and 25 being from the US and 21 from China.
These 500 companies employ 43 million in total (an average of 86,000 employees per company), which is the equivalent of the working population of Germany. The total sales of these firms stood at $18 trillion (an average of $38 billion) larger than the GDP of China.
11 Indian companies in list
India’s 11 companies led by Reliance Industries ($169 billion), followed by Tata Consultancy Services ($139 billion) and HDFC Bank ($108 billion) were also in the list. Financial Services led the way, with five companies, followed by software and services and telecommunications with 2 each.

About 49 per cent or 239 of the non-India Hurun Global 500 have a regional presence in India, spread across 10 cities, led by Mumbai with 64, by Bengaluru with 39, Gurugram (27), New Delhi (23) and Pune with (11).
“Although only 11 companies from India made it to the Hurun Global 500, it is interesting to note that more than half of the non-Indian companies in Hurun Global 500 have their regional presence in India, demonstrating the importance of India in the global supply chain and the country’s demographic dividend,” Anas Rahman Junaid, MD and Chief Researcher, Hurun India said.
While the Hurun Global 500 focuses only on non-state-controlled companies, State Bank of India with a networth of $33 billion would have made the cut off as a listed company.
“To make the cut-off of the Hurun Global 500 required a value of $31.9 billion. Companies from the Hurun Global 500 were founded in 1956 on average, with sales last year of $38 billion and 86,000 employees. Surprisingly, there has been no slowdown in a year dominated by Covid-19. Far from it. The total value rose by 25 per cent,” Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun Report, said."

Tracking gains in IT stocks amid largely positive trend in global equities and massive FPI inflows, Sensex ended 486 points higher at 49,269 and Nifty gained by 137 points to 14,484.
On Friday, Sensex ended 689 points higher at 48,782 and Nifty gained 209 points to 14,347.
In today's session, Sensex and Nifty hit new lifetime highs of 49,300 and 14,498, respectively. On Sensex , Infosys, HCL Tech, ITC, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, HUL and TCS were among the top gainers. On the other hand, Axis Bank, Maruti, ONGC, Bajaj Finance and Reliance Industries were among the laggards.
Except for banking, media and metal, all the other sectors closed in green territory, with over 3% rise in IT stocks, and 2.6% gain in auto scrips.S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities said,""Buoyed by Positive global cues, Tech stocks together with Auto stocks powered the NIFTY closer to the 14500 mark. While we did see profit booking in Metals during Afternoon Trade, the sheer momentum in IT & Auto kept the Bulls in total control ahead of Q3 earnings.""
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""Improved outlook for 3rd quarter earnings along with strong global cues helped Sensex to breach 49,000 mark. The rally in the market was led by the IT sector backed by firm earnings results, however, small and mid-cap stocks were under pressure. Hopes of a new US stimulus to be unveiled this week created an upbeat movement in Wall Street while profit booking is seen in the European markets. This ongoing rally is being fueled by strong Q3 earnings preview, foreign fund inflow and optimism around Union Budget 2021.""
Overseas, Asian stocks were trading mostly higher on Monday, with South Korean stocks surging again, led by Auto stocks on the back of news that Hyundai and Apple are set to sign partner deal on autonomous electric cars. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.
US markets closed higher last week as investors looked more confident looking past political unrest and a weak economy and focused more on prospects of further fiscal stimulus. In economic data, the US economy shed jobs for the first time in eight months in December.
European markets traded higher today on the back of expectation that new US government would come out with bigger fiscal support to help the economy.
Keshav Lahoti-Associate Equity Analyst, Angel Broking said,""Nifty started the week on a positive note and closed up by 1%. Rally was led by auto stocks due to strong demand for vehicles and IT stocks due to better than expected result of TCS for Q3FY21. Nifty and Nifty IT continues its trend of making new all time high. Sectoral indices were mixed. Global cues were negative: Dow Futures, Nasdaq Futures and FTSE were down by 0.7% , 0.5% and 0.5% respectively. We are bullish on the market. Although after the sharp rally, we are concerned about the valuation of the market. We advise investors to book profit in a small portion of their portfolio.""
Expressing views on Nifty's technical outlook, Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said,""Index opened a day with gap and managed to hold the bullish stream for a day and closed a day near good hurdle zone of 14500 with gains of nearly one percent forming a dragonfly kind of doji candle pattern on daily chart. Going forwards index has shifted its support to 14400-14300 zone if managed to hold above said levels we may see index to march towards 14550-14600 zone which is immediate hurdle on the higher side.""
Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said,"" The anticipation of better than expected earnings season combined with supportive global cues aided the upbeat start. Going forward, stock-specific volatility would remain high as earnings season would gain pace. Further, key macro data like CPI, WPI and IIP would also be actively tracked by investors. Amid all, we reiterate our positive yet cautious stance on markets and advise aligning positions according to the prevailing trend.""
On the currency front, Indian rupee, the domestic currency plunged 16 paise to end at 73.40 against US dollar, tracking weak Asian currencies and rebound in American currency.
Sugandha Sachdeva VP-Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Broking said,"" We are witnessing a reversal in the dollar index, while political stability in the U.S. and the probability of a further fiscal stimulus package has pushed the long-term U.S. yields higher.

Back home, with RBI mopping up dollar inflows, the local currency can test 73.80 to 74 levels in the coming sessions.

Future and Amazon are at loggerheads over the Indian group’s August deal with Reliance Industries Ltd. The U.S. giant alleges the deal breached some of its pre-existing contracts with Future.
A New Delhi court in December dismissed Future's request to restrain Amazon’s repeated attempts to get authorities to stall the deal. But the judge left the fate of the transaction witht he regulators.
“The court has already given their view that every institution can take a view” on the sale, Future Group founder and CEO Kishore Biyani told Reuters in an interview. “So there is no reason why things should be delayed.”
Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Biyani's remarks. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the market regulator that has been reviewing the deal for months, did not respond to a request for comment.
SEBI and India’s stock exchanges could still reject or take more time in approving the deal, which is critical for the survival of Future Retail, whose more than 1,700 outlets were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Future Retail has warned that failure to close the deal could lead to the company's liquidation and job losses for moret han 29,000 employees.
“We have restored businesses to a certain extent, but there are challenges,” said Mr. Biyani, dubbed India's retail king for transforming the country’s retailing in recent decades.
Amazon protests
The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India’s retail landscape, especially in deciding who will have an upper hand in the groceries market expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.
Following Amazon’s 2019 deal with a Future unit, the retailers groceries and fashion products are offered for sale on Amazon's website, while Future stores also act as local warehouses serving the U.S. giant’s food supply chain.
Mr. Biyani said he had no intention of changing his business ties with Amazon despite the souring relationship. Criticising Amazon, however, Mr. Biyani said he was confused what Amazon wanted to achieve by blocking his deal.
“I am disappointed,” he said. “What do they want? They want so many employees to suffer, business to go down?”
Amazon also took Future to a Singapore arbitrator, which passed an interim order in October saying the Reliance deal should be halted. Although Future says that order is not binding, the U.S. e-commerce giant is continuing its efforts to block the deal.
In a letter on Tuesday, Amazon asked BSE and NSE to suspend their review of the deal in light of the ongoing Singapore arbitration.
To buttress its case, Amazon on December 30 shared with the exchanges a confidential 63-page legal opinion signed by a former Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra. In the opinion, seen by Reuters, Mr. Misra said SEBI or any other statutory authority “cannot ignore” the interim order passed by the arbitrator.
Mr. Misra and the NSE did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment. BSE declined to comment."

Karnataka Farmers Sell Paddy to Reliance Retail Above MSP,News18,https://www.news18.com/news/india/karnataka-farmers-sell-paddy-to-reliance-retail-above-msp-3270659.html,"LAST UPDATED:
JANUARY 11, 2021, 07:53 IST","About 1,100 farmers in Karnataka signed an agreement to sell their paddy directly to Reliance Retail, arm of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), above the minimum support price (MSP) through an agro-based company at Sindhanur in the state's northern region, an official said on Sunday.
""On behalf of 1,100 farmers, who are our company's shareholders, an agreement has been signed on January 6 to sell about 1,000 tonne of their paddy (Sona Masoori rice variety) to Reliance Retail at Rs 1,950 per quintal (100 kg), which is Rs 100 above the MSP of Rs 1,850 per quintal,"" Swasthya Farmers Producing Company (SFPC) Managing Director V. Mallikarjun told IANS on phone.
Sindhanur in Raichur district is 420km from Bengaluru in the southern state.
""The agreement has been signed under the recently amended Karnataka Agricultural Marketing Committee (KAPMC) Act, 2020, which allows farmers to directly sell their produce even outside APMC yards to anyone and above MSP,"" asserted Mallikarjun.
With the consent of state Governor Vajubhai Vala, Karnataka on January 1 notified the KAPMC Act, which restricts powers of the APMCs and omits penal provisions to help farmer sell their produce directly even outside the APMC yards (mandis) to anyone who pays more than the MSP, fixed by the state government.
""Since the agreement was signed, the farmers have till Saturday delivered about 100 tonne to Reliance Retail, which has taken a warehouse of the state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) on lease in the town,"" said Mallikarjun.
The balance 900 tonne will be delivered to Reliance Retail warehouse over the next 9-10 days at the rate of 100 tonne per day.
""Though the farmers are getting Rs 100 more per quintal than the MSP, they have to bear the cost of sacks (gunny bags), transport and loading/unloading charges of the paddy at the warehouse from their fields where they harvested recently,"" noted Mallikarjun.
The 2-year-old company (SFPC) has been Promoted by the state-run Nabard (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development), an apex development finance institution, to help farmers in not only ensuring higher food production, but also get maximum returns on their investment.
""We will credit the sale proceeds of the paddy to the farmers' bank accounts directly after Reliance Retail makes the transaction with us. A third party will assess the moisture content in the paddy, which should be 16 per cent for good quality,"" added Mallikarjun.
Companies can procure farm produce across the state under the Direct Purchase Centre License granted by the state Cooperation department.
Karnataka has about 160 APMCs across the state on which about 60,000 traders and middlemen depend for livelihood.
Set up in January 2019 with Rs 10-lakh authorized capital and Rs 10,000 paid-up capital, SFPC grows a variety of crops, including rice, wheat, jowhar and millets in the agricultural lands of farmers, many of whom are its shareholders.

What’s interesting is that due to the recent rally, within a period of 30 days, ICICI Bank has become the third Indian lender to touch all-time highs in terms of market capitalisation (m-cap). ICICI Bank’s m-cap touched Rs 3.77 lakh crore and its stock price intra-day touched Rs 550.55, which was a record high.
On December 17, HDFC Bank touched an all-time high m-cap of Rs 9.74 lakh crore and Kotak Mahindra Bank touched a record high m-cap of Rs 3.99 lakh crore on December 30. However, both HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have lost value since the start of the year, with the m-cap falling by Rs 8,674.53 crore and Rs 4,990.15 crore, respectively. ICICI Bank has gained m-cap of Rs 6,524 crore since the start of the year.
Banking stocks have been rallying ahead of the third quarter results. Brokerages believe that the focus for the third quarter will be on the recognition, provision and recovery of non-performing loans. The recognition of NPLs has been on hold for the past few quarters. Kotak Institutional Equities said, “The recognition, provision and recovery cycle are currently under strain given this breakdown and we expect this issue to dominate conversations this quarter.”
The major gainers on the Nifty were Powergrid Corporation, GAIL, Hindalco, Shree Cement and Bharti Airtel, up 4.15%, 3.56%, 3.5%, 3.36% and 2.76%. The significant losers were ITC, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance, and HCL Technologies, down by 2.91%, 2.57%, 1.94%, 1.92% and 1.55%.
Despite corrections on Wednesday, market valuations remain a concern, since experts believe that the market has now reached expensive valuations and are trading above their fair values.

Markets often play according to the tunes of crowd psychology. People’s thinking and decisions most of the time are shaped by Price action and narratives.

Take a look at this Image; it simply depicts how an average trader/Investor thinks about the market in response to the Price Action in Different market stages.


After looking at the Image, Now read on…

This weekend there was a news report about Mukesh Ambani, the infamous chairman of Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) getting fined by SEBI for 2007 manipulative trading practices. Despite the significance of such news, Reliance Industries stock prices didn’t even flinch a little. Dalal Street didn’t care! Take a look at the chart over here.



Just imagine, if the same type of news headline about a Small Cap or Mid Cap Company, What would’ve happened? The Company’s shares will be in deep red turmoil on the next second. If you think about it, you can’t help yourself but wonder about the present market situation.

Not only that, Price Action showed many signs of Uptrend losing strength – Momentum Shift, Unexpected selloff, Decreasing trading volume etc. but still, we couldn’t see any strong selling pressure in Reliance Industry Stock prices.

When you think based on the earlier point I mentioned about market narrative and Crowd Psychology – Did that Imply, we are in the beginning stages of Market Euphoria? What’s your thought? Let me know in the comments!

The other two members of the tribunal include Albert van den Berg and Jan Paulsson which were proposed by Amazon and Future respectively. “All three have been appointed by SIAC,” said an industry source with direct knowledge about the development. “Now the 3 member tribunal has been set up, the arbitration process would actually start now. It would build on the merits of the emergency arbitration that took place last year.”
Michael Hwang practices as a Barrister and Arbitrator, with his main focus on international arbitration and mediation. In 1991 he was appointed a Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Singapore. He is currently on the Users Council of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and on the Advisory Board of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC).

According to the industry sources, Albert Jan van den Berg is a partner in Hanotiau & van den Berg in Brussels, Belgium. He is popular on the global arbitration circuit due to his deep knowledge and vast experience. Jan Paulsson is also known for expertise in investment treaty and commercial arbitration proceedings, according to the industry sources.
“The SIAC Registry has informed parties that the arbitral tribunal has been constituted,” said an Amazon spokesperson on Tuesday evening.
The development of the constitution of the tribunal comes at a time when the Delhi High Court in December 2020 refused to restrain Amazon from interfering in Future Retail’s deal with Reliance Retail by writing to statutory authorities. The order was pronounced by a Single Judge Bench of Justice Mukta Gupta in the suit by Future Retail Ltd after an Emergency Arbitrator of the SIAC restrained Future Group from taking any steps in furtherance of the transaction with Reliance Retail.
The Delhi High Court, prima facie, found that the suit filed by Future Retail was maintainable, the Emergency Award was valid, and that Future Retail's resolution approving the transaction with Reliance was also valid. The Court opined that it was ‘a matter of trial’ to determine whether Amazon's case outweighed FRL's (Future Retail) claim and for now, it was for the statutory authorities (or) regulators to come to their own right conclusion.
In August 2020, Future Group struck a $3.4 billion asset sale deal with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). Amazon then sent a legal notice to Future, alleging the retailer’s deal breached an agreement with the American e-commerce giant. This was because in 2019, Amazon had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future’s unlisted firms Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) for Rs 1,430 crore. As per the conditions of the deal the disputes was arbitrated under SIAC rules and Amazon won a favourable ruling.

In a related development, Kishore Biyani, Future Coupons and Future Corporate Resources have said that totally disillusioned and fed up with Amazon's lackadaisical attitude, they were left with no option but to accept the offer from Reliance.
This communication to Amazon is a response to their notices and addressed on behalf of Future Corporate Resources Private Limited (FCRPL), Kishore Biyani and other promoters.
""You were well aware that in light of the disruption caused due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the lenders were chasing various companies of the Future Group for honouring their obligations,"" said Biyani in the letter to Amazon. “You, alone, are responsible for contributing to this situation, having failed to bail out FCPL (Future Coupons) and/or the Promoters from preventing alienation or disposal of the Promoter FRL Securities.”
The letter also mentioned, “In fact during the period March to August 2020, all your actions lacked good faith. Except for offering lip service and perfunctorily attempting to show your concern, there were no serious or genuine efforts made by you.”
When asked to share comments related to the letter sent to Amazon on behalf of Future, the e-commerce company spokesperson said that “it is incorrect to say that Amazon did not offer help to Future Retail Limited as there were ongoing discussions on multiple options with partners on the one hand and with the Promotors of Future on the other, including a signed Term Sheet.”
At the further outset, the letter to Amazon also mentioned Future and other parties denied having acted contrary to and reneged on contractual obligations for personal gain or benefit, as alleged or at all."
Amazon was aware of talks with RIL for sale of retail assets: Biyani,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-was-aware-of-talks-with-ril-for-sale-of-retail-assets-biyani-121010500750_1.html,"Last Updated at January 5, 2021 22:21 IST","Future Group Founder and CEO Kishore Biyani on Tuesday said Amazon was fully aware of his group's talks with Reliance Industries for the sale of retail assets that followed the US giant offering no concrete help to tide over the cash crisis.
Opening up after being locked in an intense legal battle with Amazon over the Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance, Biyani in an interview with PTI said the US giant's 2019 investment in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) -- Future Retail's parent -- was for coupon and gifting business only and the same could continue post-retail assets going to Reliance.
He hoped to complete the deal with Reliance within two months of Sebi approval.
While the arbitration would commence later in January over the plea filed by Amazon contesting the deal with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Biyani said both the deal and arbitration process would continue in ""parallel"" as the deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led group is not related with the e-commerce major's stake in one of the group firms, Future Coupons.
Biyani said Future Group had approached them several times after its retail business was massively hit after the lockdown and its debt level zoomed.
""The day COVID and lockdown started, since then we were in continuous engagement with Amazon. That's not the case that they (Amazon) were not aware of. We had written to them somewhere in March also about the price deterioration and invocation of shares,"" Biyani told PTI.
There was a clause through which Amazon could replace lenders with some others which can help them (Future) to retain the ownership of the shares if it falls, he added.
""COVID had happened and things did not materialise then. After that, we were in discussion with them (Amazon) through the whole transaction. Even when Reliance was part of the negotiation, they were always aware of that,"" he added.
Asked as to how many times Future Group approached Amazon, he said, ""we were in continuous dialogue. We had approached them multiple times. We had calls and meetings"".
Biyani said Amazon was also apprised when there were exclusive talks with RIL.
""After the matter has become legal (sub-judice), we have not spoken,""he said.
While noting that Amazon's response was always ""let's find a solution"", Biyani said they never got any solution from Amazon except ""lots of paper works"".
""To be honest, we never got a concrete solution,"" Biyani said, adding, ""we approached RIL only after things were not moving. You cannot work with one option at a time"".
However, Amazon has contended this version.
""It is incorrect to say that Amazon did not offer help to Future Retail Limited as there were ongoing discussions on multiple options with partners on the one hand and with the promoters of Future on the other, including a signed Term Sheet,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.
Amazon had dragged Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), which on October 25 passed an interim award in favour of the e-commerce giant.
Future Retail has questioned the move and said the order was ""not binding"" and had even approached Delhi High Court, which last month upheld Amazon's right to make representations to statutory authorities against the Future Group-Reliance Retail deal. The court also gave a go-ahead to the regulatory authorities to decide about the deal in accordance with the rules and regulations.
Future Group has approached Sebi to expedite the review of the proposed deal and issue a no-objection certificate while Amazon has urged that the review of the ""impugned transaction"" be suspended.
""We are responding to what they (Amazon) are writing. We are not the first writers,"" Biyani said when asked about the ongoing war of letters between Amazon and Future.
""We had applied for CCI permission, which we have got. We have applied to BSE and NSE, which is linked to Sebi's approval,"" he said.
Biyani does not expect any hurdle after the order of the Delhi High Court which has directed the regulators to take an independent call on the issue.
""I do not see (it taking) much time. Once we get Sebi approval, then we have to go NCLT for creditors, lenders and shareholders' approval,"" he said adding that after Sebi approval, it would take 45 to 60 days.
The process of appointing an arbitrator at SIAC has not been done yet and Biyani said the deal with RIL has nothing to do with Amazon.
He hinted that the arbitration and the process of completion of the Rs 24,713 crore-deal with Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), subsidiary of RIL would continue in parallel.
""It is a dispute between the promoters and Amazon in a way because they are part of a company (Future Coupons), which we built for gifting and loyalty business. That company has invested in FRL and they are not directly the owners of FRL,"" he said.
Biyani also emphasised that the partnership with Amazon was for coupon and gifting business only and to work with Future brands and portfolios and to sell it on Amazon. ""That continues today also,"" he added.
On being asked as what would be left for Future Coupon to do after the assets of the group are transferred to RIL, Biyani said, ""it can still continue to hold the shares of the resultant entity. It will continue to do the gifting business"".
Biyani also hinted that post completion of the deal, an exit route may be offered to Amazon.
""The best solution is conciliation on every issue,"" he said, adding, ""we would love to find a solution"".
In 2019, Amazon agreed to purchase 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after three to ten years. Future Coupons holds 7.3 per cent equity through convertible warrants in Future Retail, that operates popular supermarket and hypermarket chains such as Big Bazaar."
"Telecom tower damage: HC issues notice to Punjab, Centre on Reliance Jio plea",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telecom-tower-damage-hc-issues-notice-to-punjab-centre-on-reliance-jio-plea/articleshow/80112533.cms,"Last Updated: Jan 05, 2021, 02:21 PM IST","CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday issued notices to the Punjab government and the Centre on a plea filed by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, seeking action against ""miscreants"" damaging its telecom infrastructure and forcibly closing its stores in the state.

During the ongoing agitation by farmers against three new farm laws enacted by the Centre, over 1500 mobile towers in Punjab have been damaged.

Reliance Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd NSE 3.63 % (RIL), on Monday, submitted in its plea that ""vested"" interests are engaged in spreading ""false rumours"" against it and that the petitioner, its parent company and its affiliates had no plans to enter corporate or contract farming.

Justice Sudhir Mittal has issued a notice of motion for February 8, according to Aashish Mittal, the counsel for Reliance Jio.

The company has made the state of Punjab through its chief secretary, Union Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Telecommunications and the Punjab Director General of Police as respondents in the matter.

In the civil writ petition, Reliance Jio has also sought appropriate directions to respondents for an investigation into the ""well-orchestrated and sustained disinformation campaign"" being carried out by vested interests and miscreants against it.

In the petition, the company has stated that in the past few weeks, its over 1,500 telecom towers were damaged or rendered inoperative by miscreants crippling its mobile network in Punjab.

A number of its centres and stores were also forcibly closed by miscreants by using ""illegal force and intimidation,"" it submitted.

The petitioner submitted that its subscribers were being forced to port to other networks, while its employees were being subjected to grave threat to life and forcibly prevented from serving subscribers in the state.

According to the petition, vested interests inimical to the petitioner and its parent company RIL, are engaged in spreading false rumours to the effect that the petitioner and its affiliates were somehow a beneficiary of recent legislation passed by Parliament governing the marketing of agricultural produce.

In a statement, Reliance said it ""has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws currently debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them"".

The company also sought the constitution of a competent authority under the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act for the assessment of losses caused to it."

D-Street veterans shift back to unlisted market as stock valuations turn pricey,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/d-street-veterans-shift-back-to-unlisted-market-as-stock-valuations-turn-pricey/articleshow/80109153.cms,"Last Updated: Jan 05, 2021, 10:25 AM IST","NEW DELHI: The pandemic-hit Dalal Street witnessed a sharp rebound in the last nine months, leading to a historic bull run, producing a large number of outperformers across market segments.

The grey market – or the unofficial market for trading in unlisted shares – replicated a similar performance during this period.

However, analysts say a lot of investors shifted from the unlisted market to the listed one during the year, as better opportunities emerged in the latter. As valuations now turn expensive in the secondary market, many of them now start shifted back into the grey market, they said.

During the year, a few quality names from the unlisted market decently rewarded those investors, who kept their patience even amid strong panic.

Care Health Insurance, formerly known as Religare health, emerged the leader of this pack of performers. The unlisted stock turned a multibagger, surging to Rs 125-130 from Rs 30-35 during the year. Health insurance players saw a surge in volume during the health crisis.

Unlisted shares of IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings (CSK) jumped over three times during the year from Rs 25-30 to Rs 80-85, as the 13th edition of the star-studded tournament got shifted to the UAE. The company’s annual report showed veteran investor Radhakishan Damani has been investing in the stock actively.

Mobile gaming company Nazara Technologies and Studds Accessories also doubled share prices during the year. Both were beneficiaries of the Covid lockdown. The Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-backed Nazara Technologies and helmet manufacturer Studds are eyeing IPOs soon.

Sandip Ginodia, CEO, Altius Investech said that during the lockdown, a large number of retail investors moved from the unlisted to listed space as the number of scrips and their availability is limited in the former.

“The unlisted space has its own set of entry barriers and risks, while the listed space turned a low-hanging fruit. This space works purely on fundamentals, which require more maturity, bigger capital, greater risk appetite and a long-term investment horizon,” he said.

Shares of Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, almost trebled to Rs 1,350-1,400 during the year. This entity created some buzz as a handful of PE investors participated in the stake sale. HDB Financial Services, NSE and Suryoday Small Finance Bank also rewarded investors with handsome returns.

The unlisted market is unregulated, but it is completely legitimate. However, all deals are carried out in the cash segment. “There is no F&O segment or margin requirement in this market. This makes it less volatile during tough times,” said Dinesh Gupta, Co-founder of UnlistedZone.

Ginodia and Gupta said the unlisted market is riskier as often there is huge misselling of products. Yet, the off-market offer better value to investors with deep pockets.

Many analysts believe the unlisted space has better potential to create long-term wealth, as it offers better opportunity for value picking at an early stage of a business. “This is why renowned investors are switching to this space,” he said.

Vivek Bajaj, Co-founder, StockEdge, said visibility and fair price discovery of this market is very limited.

""The unlisted market would now be buzzing again, as valuations in the listed space get inflated. The off-market may lead the next wave of bull run, as the unlisted scrips have underperformed their listed peers,” he said."

"No plans to enter contract farming, buy agricultural land: Reliance Industries",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/reliance-denies-plans-to-enter-contract-farming-backs-procurement-at-msp/articleshow/80091998.cms,"Last Updated: Jan 05, 2021, 08:10 AM IST","MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries (RIL) said it has no plans to enter contract farming and has nothing to do with the three agricultural laws that have sparked the farmers’ protest. It wouldn’t benefit in any way from the legislation, the company said in a statement on Monday, accusing rivals and others of a “malicious and motivated campaign.”

Reliance Jio Infocomm, RIL’s telecom unit, moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court, seeking urgent action to stop destruction of its towers and infrastructure.

“Miscreants indulging in vandalism have been instigated and aided by vested interests and our business rivals,” RIL said. “Taking advantage of the ongoing farmers’ agitation near the National Capital, these vested interests have launched an incessant, malicious and motivated vilification campaign against Reliance, which has absolutely no basis in truth.”

RIL has presented the court with facts that establish that it has no link to the agricultural legislation. “These facts establish that Reliance has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws currently (being) debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them,” RIL said. “As such, the sole nefarious purpose of linking the name of Reliance to these laws is to harm our businesses and damage our reputation.”

Neither RIL nor its group companies were engaged in “corporate” or “contract” farming, it said. Punjab’s Congress government has been named as a respondent in the petition.

‘Have not purchased any agricultural land’
RIL also sought compensation for losses suffered.

Jio asked the court to pass appropriate orders “directing the respondents to take action against, counteract and thwart the efforts being made by vested interests and miscreants to completely sabotage and damage the petitioner’s network infrastructure and the petitioner and its affiliates’ centres and stores in Punjab.”

Without this, the telco said it will suffer further losses and its infrastructure in the state will be “completely sabotaged.” It sought compensation for damage to more than 1,500 towers, owned or operated by Jio, that were destroyed, leading to a loss of hundreds of crores of rupees.

“The petitioner and its parent company — including its retail arm Reliance Retail — have not purchased any agricultural land, directly or indirectly, anywhere in India for the purpose of ‘corporate’ or ‘contract farming’ and have absolutely no plans, now or in the future, to do so,” Jio said in its petition, a copy of which was seen by ET.

The attacks on Jio’s telecom infrastructure, mostly in Punjab and BJP-ruled Haryana, began in late October, amid calls by protesting farmers to boycott products and services of RIL and the Adani Group. This was triggered by rumours that the new farm laws would allegedly benefit the business houses at the cost of the farmers.

Protesters disconnected power supplies to the towers and cut fibre, disrupting phone services, despite repeated clarifications that neither of the business groups procure foodgrain from farmers.


Rivals to blame
Jio has accused its rivals – Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea – of misusing the situation to poach subscribers. Punjab and Haryana are high revenue-generating states for telcos.

Jio has since called on the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to suspend mobile number portability in the two states. Jio accounted for 14 million users, or 36% of the mobile phone users in Punjab, and 9.4 million, or 34%, in Haryana. In its complaints to the telecom department, Jio has also accused the channel partners of its two rivals of inciting and provoking agitators.

Airtel and Vi have said the accusations are baseless.

Jio had written to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh in late October on the matter, prompting him to issue two directives to stop the destruction of telecom infrastructure in the state.

In its statement, RIL said the destruction was “well-orchestrated.”

The telco has petitioned for the impacted sites to be restored and for the court to direct respondents to “constitute a competent authority in terms of Section 7 of the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act, 2014, to investigate and report appropriate sanctions and actions against the vested interests and miscreants.”

It also asked the court to give directions “to set up a machinery to investigate the damage caused and to award compensation related thereto in relation to the damages caused to the petitioners’ infrastructure.”

RIL pledged to support higher farm income, saying it always insisted that its suppliers strictly abide by the minimum support price (MSP) or any other mechanism determined by the government to ensure remunerative prices for agricultural produce.

The protesting farmers have been demanding legal backing for guaranteed purchase of their produce at MSP, while repealing the farm laws. The government says the three new laws free up agriculture. The farmers say the laws will make them vulnerable to corporates and undermine price guarantees."

In this context, Mukesh Ambani's company also clarified that it is not in the business of corporate or contract farming and has absolutely no plans to enter this business.
It has never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so, RIL said.
The company also said it has ""nothing whatsoever to do with the three contentious farm laws being debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them"".
Far from hurting the interests of Indian farmers, the businesses of Reliance have actually benefited them and the Indian public at large, it added.

“We deny that we have acted contrary to and reneged on contractual obligations for personal gain or benefit, as alleged or at all. Such assertions are wholly unsubstantiated,” it said. A copy of the letter was reviewed by BusinessLine.
The letter, written to Amazon on December 31, was signed by Kishore Biyani and other promoters of the Future Group, Future Corporate Resources Private Limited, and FCPL.
Slump sale
The Future group and Amazon have been at loggerheads ever since the former announced a ₹24,000-crore slump sale of assets to the Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries. Amazon had alleged that Future Retail, the retail arm of Future Group, had breached a contract by signing a deal with RIL and hence owed damages.
Earlier, during the hearing in the Delhi High Court, Harish Salve, Senior counsel who appeared on behalf of FRL, had said if there was a breach of contract, Biyani of FCPL owed damages, and not FRL.
Now, FCPL has said: “We deny that there has been any Event of Default, as alleged or at all, and that we are liable for damages or liquidated damages.”
Promoters’ stance
The company’s promoters explained that between March and August, 2020, post the downfall of its stock prices and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, FCPL had asked Amazon for financial assistance but no help was forthcoming.
In April, the promoters of FRL had to pledge more shares owing to the falling stock prices. “All your actions lacked good faith. Except for offering lip service and perfunctorily attempting to show your concern, there were no serious or genuine efforts made by you,” Future said.
Queries sent to Amazon remained unanswered."

JANUARY 04, 2021, 18:03 IST","Dispelling the rumours that Reliance Industries Limited is placed to benefit from the three farm reform laws passed by the central government, the conglomerate on Monday said it has no plans of entering the contract or the corporate farming business, and it has never bought agricultural land for corporate farming or contract farming and had no plans to do so in the future as well.
In a statement, RIL said it does not purchase food grains directly from farmers, and its suppliers buy from farmers only at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) level. It also clarified that it had never entered into any long-term procurement contracts at low prices, or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices.
“Reliance and its affiliates fully share and support the aspiration of Indian farmers to get a fair and profitable price on a predictable basis for what they produce with exemplary hard work, innovation and dedication. Indeed we shall insist on our suppliers to strictly abide by the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism, and/or any other mechanism for remunerative price for farm produce, as may be determined and implemented by the government,” the company said.
The Mukesh Ambani-led company categorically stated its position that neither Reliance nor any of its subsidies, had purchased any agricultural land, directly or indirectly, anywhere in India, for the purpose of “corporate” or “contract” farming. “We have absolutely no plans to do so,” it added.
RIL further said it had filed a writ petition in Punjab and Haryana High Court against vandalism of its communication towers, and said some vested interests and business rivals were behind the vandalism. RIL urged the High Court to issue a suitable order to help protect its employees and property from vandalism.
As many as 1,500 mobile towers and telecom gear owned by RIL’s Jio have been damaged in Punjab in recent weeks, allegedly by farmers protesting against the new agricultural legislations. In November, some groups of farmers had shut down Reliance Fresh stores in parts of Punjab. This came amid resentment among some farmers that the new laws will pave the way for corporate exploitation.
Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been staging a sit-in protest along Delhi's borders. The protest started on November 26. The farmers are demanding a complete rollback of the new farm reform laws and a guarantee on the MSP system being retained.
Multiple rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmers’ union leaders have ended in a stalemate. Protesting farmers fear that the new agricultural reform laws will dismantle the MSP system and corporatise farming. However, the Centre has maintained that these reforms will benefit farmers.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) will file a petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, seeking the intervention of the government to stop vandalism of its communication infrastructure by miscreants, the company said on January 4.
In a media statement, the company said the “acts of violence have endangered the lives of thousands of its employees and caused damage and disruption to the vital communications infrastructure” and service outlets run by its subsidiaries in the states of Haryana and Punjab.
In recent weeks, there have been reports of around 1,500 mobile towers and telecom gear owned by Jio being vandalised in Punjab, allegedly by farmers protesting against the new farm reform laws that seek to liberalise the market for agricultural produce and commodities.
In November, some groups of farmers had shut down Reliance Fresh stores in parts of Punjab. Some farmers fear that the new laws will pave the way for corporate exploitation and their land could be ""snatched"" by big firms.
RIL said those involved in vandalism were “instigated and aided” by vested interests and business rivals.

The company said it would seek punitive and deterrent action against those involved, so that it can run all its businesses smoothly in the two states.
“The falsehood of the campaign becomes crystal clear from the following irrefutable facts, which we have placed before the Honourable High Court. These facts establish that Reliance has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws currently debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them,” Reliance said in the statement.

Over 1,500 Jio telecom towers have been damaged in Punjab, which has led to disruption in services in several parts of the state. Power supply to several towers that relay telecom signals was snapped and cables cut in many parts of Punjab. Notably, Jio is facing ire from the protesting farmers as they allege that some portions of the law are believed to be favouring large business groups, particularly Reliance Industries (RIL) and Adani Group. The farmers have been making calls to boycott RIL and Adani Group as a result of this perception.

Multiple rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmers’ union leaders have ended in a stalemate. Protesting farmers fear that the new agricultural reform laws will dismantle the MSP system and corporatise farming. However, the Centre has maintained that these reforms will benefit farmers.

In the previous round, the Centre and farmer unions agreed on issues related to the electricity act and stubble burning but there was no agreement on the two key demands—legal guarantee for MSP and withdrawal of the three farm laws.

An Rs25cr penalty was imposed in RIL and Rs15cr on Ambani. Also, Sebi penalised two other entities namely Navi Mumbai SEZ with Rs20cr fine and Mumbai SEZ with Rs10cr fine.

Sebi in its verdict note stated that RIL fraudulently cornered nearly 93% of open interest in RPL November Futures, when the said 12 Agents took short positions in F&O Segment on its behalf.

Sebi adds that a common person connected with RIL had placed orders in the Cash Segment on behalf of RIL and in the F&O segment on behalf of the Agents. On the date of settlement of RPL November Futures, i.e., on November 29, 2007, RIL sold 1.95 crore RPL shares on NSE Cash Segment in the last 10 minutes of trading resulting in fall in the prices on the Cash Segment, which artificially depressed the settlement price of RPL November Futures.

Further, Sebi said, ""This resulted in profits on the huge short positions held by the Agents in RPL November Futures and the said profits were transferred back to RIL by the Agents as per prior agreement.

""The above strategy was undertaken by RIL has resulted in manipulation of settlement price of RPL November Futures and prices of RPL shares in the Cash Segment,"" Sebi adds.

""Any attempt to deviate from such standards will not only erode the confidence of the investors but also affect the integrity of the markets,"" Sebi adds further.

Following the above, Sebi explains that the transactions executed by Noticees were structured and executed in such manner so as to escape the notice of regulatory authorities, investors as they were not in the public domain.

Therefore, Sebi concludes that the said scheme of manipulation was deceptive and against the interest of the securities markets.

RIL has been in a feud with the market watchdog since 2007 against the latter's allegation about fraudulent trading in the F&O space of RPL's securities.

Following which, the regulator in March 2017, had banned RIL and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives. Also, Sebi had asked RIL to disgorge about Rs447cr along with interests.

At around 2.38 pm, RIL was trading at Rs1989 per piece flat compared to the previous closing on Sensex. The stock has touched an intraday high and low of Rs1997.90 per piece and Rs1967.90 per piece. "
"Reliance, BP commit to pay for any shortfall in KG-D6 production to buyers",The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/reliance-bp-commit-to-pay-for-any-shortfall-in-kg-d6-production-to-buyers/article33485892.ece,"JANUARY 03, 2021 13:32 IST","Reliance Industries Ltd. and its partner BP Plc. of U.K. have committed to pay in cash for any natural gas volumes they are unable to deliver to customers from the next wave of discoveries in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block.
According to draft gas sales and purchase agreement (GSPA) Reliance and BP have shared along with price discovery bids for incremental gas from the R-Cluster fields in KG-D6 block, the sellers will reimburse buyer money equivalent to gas sourced from alternate source to make up for any volumes they are unable to deliver.
The buyer on his part will be obliged to offtake the committed gas volumes or pay for it (take or pay).
The volumes not taken but paid for can be taken in subsequent quarters, the GSPA said.
These ship or pay and take or pay obligations will be waived in the event of force majeure events such as any act of God like earthquake and floods, fire, epidemic, acts of war, strike and lockouts, delays due to government/ regulatory actions and court orders.
Also, “loss, failure, impediment, restriction in output or deliverability of reservoirs in the gas fields” will be a force majeure event, it said.
Reliance had a decade back signed up to sell 60 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the first set of gas fields in the KG-D6 block, but the output rapidly declined due to reservoir issues, leaving users such as power plants stranded.
The company had not reimbursed buyers for the shortfall, calling it an act beyond its control. The government had, however, levied penalties on it for failure to produce the committed volumes — an act that the company has challenged through an arbitration. The outcome of the arbitration is pending.
While those initial fields have ceased to produce, Reliance-BP last month started output from the R-Cluster fields.
They in November 2019 sold the first 5 mmscmd from the R-Cluster field at a rate benchmarked against Brent crude oil, the duo has now invited bids for selling incremental 7.5 mmscmd of incremental output that is likely to be available from February benchmarked to a gas index, according to a notice inviting offers.
Reliance and BP have sought rates equivalent to JKM or Japan/Korea Liquefied Natural Gas Import Price.
Bidders have been asked to “quote the variable denoted as ‘’V’’ in U.S. dollar per million British thermal units (MMBtu) terms”.
“The gas price (in $/MMBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM + V,” the notice said.
GCV stands for gross calorific value.
‘’V’’ can be a positive, zero or negative number and up to two decimal places, but it cannot be less than (-) 0.30 $/MMBtu, it said.
This means users will have to quote -0.30 or higher value of ‘’V’’.
At the current JKM price, KG-D6 gas would cost $6 per mmBtu at the base or cut off price.
This is higher than $4.2 to 4.4 per MMBtu rate at which the first 5 mmscmd are sold at Brent crude oil benchmark. Brent crude oil is presently in the range of $50 to 51 per barrel.
However, the rate discovered will be subject to the cap the government places on gas price. The cap for six months to March 31, 2021, is $4.06 per mmBtu.
Reliance-BP is investing $5 billion in bringing to production three deepwater gas projects in the Block KG-D6 R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ — which together are expected to meet about 15% of India’’s gas demand by 2023.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12.9 mmscmd while satellites, which are supposed to begin output from the third quarter of the 2021 calendar year, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in the third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 — the largest among the lot — were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.
Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6% interest, while BP holds the remaining stake."

The Sebi, in a statement, observed that RIL had entered into a well-planned operation with its Agents to corner the open interest in the RPL Futures and to earn undue profits from the sale of RPL shares in both cash & futures segments and to dump large number of RPL shares in the cash segment during the last ten minutes of trading on the settlement day resulting in a fall in the settlement price.
It also observed that Mukesh Ambani, being the chairman & managing director of RIL, was responsible for its day-to-day affairs and thereby, liable for the manipulative trading done by RIL.
Further, the market regulator observed that Navi Mumbai SEZ and Mumbai SEZ had allegedly aided and abetted RIL by providing funds to one of the agents appointed by RIL, who in turn provided funds to other 11 agents for making the margin payments for the short positions in RPL November Futures.
Consequently, Sebi imposed a penalty of Rs 25 crore on RIL, Rs 15 crore on Mukesh Ambani, Rs 20 crore on Navi Mumbai SEZ and Rs 10 crore on Mumbai SEZ.
RIL is India's largest private sector company. Its activities span hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and digital services.
RIL's consolidated net profit fell 6.6% to Rs 10,602 crore on 25.5% decline in net sales to Rs 1,11,236 crore in Q2 September 2020 over Q2 September 2019.
The scrip gained 0.13% to Rs 1987.15 on Friday. It traded in the range of 1982.30 and 1997.30 during the day.

In its order dated Jan. 1, the Securities and Exchange Board of India said Reliance and its agents operated to allegedly earn undue profits from the sale of shares in Reliance Petroleum Ltd., a former unit, in both the cash and futures markets. Reliance Industries needs to pay 250 million rupees and Ambani, the chairman, is liable for the alleged manipulative trading, Sebi said.
A spokesman for Reliance said he couldn’t immediately comment on the order.
After years of investigation, Sebi observed in 2017 that Reliance, along with 12 unlisted trading houses, carried out unlawful transactions in the shares of Reliance Petroleum. They bought stock between March and November of 2007, and then the company took short positions -- bets that the share price would fall -- in November futures before starting to sell the stock in order to push down the price, according to Sebi.
Reliance Industries Falls After Manipulation Charge, Trading Ban
The same year, the regulator also told the companies to return gains of 4.47 billion rupees plus interest and banned Reliance from trading futures and options on India’s equity markets for a year. Reliance had appealed the order saying they were “unjustifiable sanctions” on genuine transactions carried out in the interest of shareholders.
Reliance Petroleum merged with Reliance Industries in 2009. The petroleum entity was a listed subsidiary of the Ambani-owned firm and owned a 580,000 barrel-a-day refinery in a special economic zone at Jamnagar in the western Indian state of Gujarat, where the group has the world’s largest refining and petrochemicals complex.

Fines of Rs 25 crore and Rs 15 crore have been imposed on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Ambani, respectively. Besides, Navi Mumbai SEZ Pvt Ltd has been asked to pay a penalty of Rs 20 crore and Mumbai SEZ Ltd has been directed to pay Rs 10 crore.

""In the instant case, the general investors were not aware that the entity behind the above F&O segment transactions was RIL. The execution of the... fraudulent trades affected the price of the RPL securities in both cash and F&O segments and harmed the interests of other investors,"" he said in the order.
While noting that execution of manipulative trades affects the price discovery system itself, the adjudicating officer said, ""I am of the view that such acts of manipulation have to be dealt sternly so as to dissuade manipulative activities in the capital markets."" There was no immediate comment from RIL on the matter.
On March 24, 2017, Sebi had ordered RIL and certain other entities to disgorge over Rs 447 crore in the RPL case. In November 2020, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) dismissed the company's appeal against the order.
At that time, RIL had said it would challenge the tribunal's order in the Supreme Court.
Apart from ordering disgorgement of money, Sebi had in March 2017 also prohibited RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the F&O segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for one year.
As per the order passed on Friday, Sebi said RIL had entered into a scheme of manipulative trades in respect of the sale of its stake in RPL.
However, before undertaking sale transactions in the cash segment, RIL fraudulently booked large short positions in the RPL November futures through 12 agents with whom it had entered into an agreement to circumvent position limits for a commission payment, it added.
""As a result, RIL fraudulently cornered nearly 93 per cent of open interest in RPL November Futures, when the said 12 agents took short positions in F&O Segment on its behalf,"" the order said.

Jio to make calls to any network in India free,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/jio-to-make-calls-to-any-network-in-india-free/story-qx9XEPG1PaTUJwEdoGbOhI.html,"PUBLISHED ON JAN 01, 2021 06:18 AM IST","Voice calls made by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd subscribers to rival networks within India will be free from 1 January, India’s largest mobile operator by market share said on Thursday.
The decision to stop charging for calls comes as the telecom regulator has mandated that telcos will not have to pay so-called termination charges to rival networks starting 1 January. The termination fee was set at 6 paise per minute till 31 December by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
“For context, in September 2019, as per directions of the Trai, the bill-and-keep regime is being implemented in the country from 1 January, ending IUC (interconnection usage charge) for all domestic voice calls,” said Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the parent of Jio, in a stock exchange filing.
Under the bill-and-keep regime, telecom operators do not have to pay termination charges to each other.
On Thursday, Jio said it was forced to charge its customers for off-network voice calls at a rate equivalent to the applicable IUC because Trai deferred the implementation of zero IUC regime by a year till 31 December 2020.
“This was expected, as Trai mandated zero-IUC charges from 1 Jan ‘21 and RJio (Reliance Jio) had committed that this charge would be only till IUC is not zero,” said Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy— broking and distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Jani said the revenue impact for Reliance Jio would be “insignificant” as it already offers 1,000 minutes free off-network calls to its users.
“While doing so, Jio had assured its users that this charge would continue only till the time Trai abolished IUC. Today, Jio has delivered on that promise and made off-net voice calls free again,” RIL said in the statement.
Reliance Jio was launched in September 2016, following which India’s telecom sector witnessed massive disruption with the telco’s almost free voice and data services. Jio’s offers not only helped it gain a major share of the market but led to a situation of shrinking revenues and mounting debt for rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd.

By Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - India's markets watchdog fined Reliance Industries RELI.NS 250 million rupees ($3.42 million) and its chairman Mukesh Ambani 150 million rupees on Friday for what it said were fraudulent trades while selling a stake in a subsidiary in 2007.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) alleged that the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate took derivative short positions in shares of separately listed Reliance Petroleum in 2007 through third parties before it sold a 5% stake in the business.
Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for company comment and comment from Chairman Ambani.
The latest ruling follows a 2017 order https://www.reuters.com/article/us-reliance-sebi-idUSKBN16V2I0 for Reliance Industries to surrender about 4.5 billion rupees plus 12% annual interest for what the regulator said were unlawful gains from that deal. It also barred Reliance and some third parties from trading in derivatives for one year.
At the time, Reliance Industries said the trades examined by SEBI were ""genuine and bona fide transactions"" and that SEBI had ""misconstrued the true nature of the transactions and imposed unjustifiable sanctions"".
The group is awaiting a Supreme Court appeal hearing against the 2017 ruling.
""By this penalty, SEBI is showing its teeth,"" Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert and founder of proxy advisory firm InGovern, said of Friday's ruling.
""The said scheme of manipulation was deceptive and against the interest of the securities markets,"" SEBI said in Friday's 95-page order https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2021/adjudication-order-in-respect-4-entities-in-the-matter-of-reliance-petroleum-limited_48637.html, adding that Ambani was responsible for the company's activities.

The Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed that Zhong's net worth has surged $70.9 billion making him the richest man in Asian above both Mukesh Ambani and China's Jack Ma.

It has been one the fastest growth in wealth. Two major factors behind the surge in his wealth are the mega listings of his vaccine manufacturing company Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co in April followed by that of his bottled water company Nongfu on the stock markets.
Nongfu Spring, the maker of bottled water, turned out to be one of Hong Kong's best listings and its shares have jumped 155 per cent since their debut, and the shares of the vaccine company have increased over 2,000 per cent.
Zhong has seen ups and downs in his life and things have not always been this good. The 66-year-old has tried his fortune in several spheres and has even worked as a journalist, a construction worker, a beverage sales agent before getting on with his own business.
However, according to industry and market experts, the stock market blockbuster of Nongfu's listing strengthened his position. His vaccine making firm is also involved in developing Covid-19 vaccines.
Globally, he is the 11th richest individual, just a rank above Ambani, who is the 12th richest in the world now with a net worth of $76.9 billion. Ambani's net worth has grown by $18.3 billion."

Crisil Risk and Infrastructure Solutions has been appointed by the consortium to conduct the bidding process for sale of gas through an online web based electronic bidding platform.
The consortium is currently producing and developing deep water gas fields under the production sharing contract with the government.
Earlier this month, RIL and BP had announced the start of production from the R Cluster, ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the Kakinada coast.
RIL and BP are developing three deepwater gas projects in block KG D6 Â- R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ Â- which together are expected to meet 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023. These projects will utilise the existing hub infrastructure in KG D6 block.
RIL is the operator of KG D6 with a 66.67 per cent participating interest and BP holds a 33.33% participating interest.
R Cluster is the first of the three projects to come onstream. The field is located about 60 kilometers from the existing KG D6 Control & Riser Platform (CRP) off the Kakinada coast and comprises a subsea production system tied back to CRP via a subsea pipeline. Located at a water depth of greater than 2000 meters, it is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia.

Future group firms receive large orders from Reliance,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/future-group-firms-receive-large-orders-from-reliance/articleshow/80014573.cms,"Last Updated: Dec 30, 2020, 09:20 AM IST","Future group firms have started getting large orders from Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 %, CEO Kishore Biyani said in an email to his employees.

The group firms Future Consumer and Future Enterprises have recently received orders from Reliance Industries.

This will be a big support for the cash-strapped future group firms before the completion of Rs 24,713 crore buyout of the country's second-largest retailer by Reliance Industries' arm.

Ecommerce major Amazon has raised objections over the deal.

Amazon had dragged Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) after a Biyani group firm signed a pact to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance in August this year.

""We have received a large order from Reliance as well in Future Consumer and in Future Enterprises,"" Biyani said in the email.

On the future course of action, he said the group is conceptualising two new brands that will offer products in multiple categories in fashion and FMCG.

""There is a lot of work that has been going on with these brands and you will see them come alive in stores by March,"" he added.

While talking about the current year, Biyani said the COVID situation has interrupted everything.

""Now, things are steadily coming back to their usual rhythm. A new year gives us an opportunity to start afresh,"" he said. ""I am starting the year 2021 with a fresh mind and the determination to get back the rhythm and normalcy in every sphere of life and business"".

""As you are aware, we have started opening new stores as well. A new Big Bazaar opened in Palassio Mall in Lucknow in December and has received very encouraging response from customers. One more Big Bazaar store is scheduled to open in Mokama in Bihar in January,"" Biyani informed.

Highlighting the contribution of employees, he said the business is not about stores, brands or offices.

""It is all about individuals – you, me and every one of us who come together to fuel our stores, brands and business. We need to come together as teams, work together in offices and bring our rhythm back to achieve our goals,"" he added.

The group is fully activating its offices as well as workspaces and all employees will be updated on the new work schedules, guidelines and various organisational announcements related to new leaders and teams, he said.

Biyani also mentioned about Future group's ""Sabse Sasta Din on 26th January"".

""Let us together recreate it on this 26th January. We should use this as the opportunity to announce to our customers that we are now fully geared and ready to meet all their expectations,"" he said. ""At the Home Office, we have formed a core leadership team to support zones and stores in ensuring that we make the best 26th January sales ever"".

Biyani also invited marketing and advertising ideas from the employees.

Both Future Group and Amazon had last week written to market regulator Sebi with contrasting requests over the Rs 24,713 crore buyout of assets of India's second-largest retailer.

Future Group has requested the regulator to expedite the review of the proposed deal and issue a no-objection certificate, while Amazon has urged that the review of the ""impugned transaction"" be suspended.

Future Group firm Future Retail Ltd (FRL) approached the Delhi High Court, which earlier this month upheld Amazon's right to make representations to statutory authorities against the Future Group-Reliance Retail deal.

The court had also given a go-ahead to the regulatory authorities to decide about the deal in accordance with the rules and regulations.

Amazon in its letter to Sebi said FRL's request for an injunction against the online firm has been rejected by the Delhi High Court, and that the court has held that the interim award by SIAC is valid under Indian law."
Attacks on Jio towers continue; association to write another letter to Punjab Police,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/attacks-on-jio-towers-continue-association-to-write-another-letter-to-punjab-police/story/426280.html,"Manu Kaushik | December 29, 2020 | Updated 00:01 IST","The ire of the protesting farmers continues to cost dearly to the Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio. Even after the appeal from the Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to stop attacks on the telecom infrastructure of Jio, the attack on its towers and optical fiber material has not been halted. As per Jio sources, the farmers have damaged over 1,300 towers, and burned optical fiber bundles of the telco.
The towers infrastructure association TAIPA, which had written a letter to IGP (Law and Order) of Punjab Police, is planning to write another letter since the attacks have escalated over the past week. On the last Friday alone, some 700 Jio towers were damaged, which primarily involve cutting off the power supply. ""We are taking cognisance of the damage done, and will write another letter shortly,"" says T.R. Dua, director general at TAIPA.
Last Tuesday, TAIPA's letter mentioned the incidents of forceful shutting down of telecom towers in Bhatinda and Hoshiarpur districts. The letter also said that the protesting farmers had threatened the employees and technicians of physical harm/manhandling in case the tower sites are restored. Since then, farmers have damaged infra in more districts of Punjab.
So far, the farmer protests have affected Jio in two phases. In the first phase, the telco wrote a letter to TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) in mid-December seeking stringent action against the rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for ""unethically"" fanning the farmers' ire to port out Jio's customers to their networks. Jio had said that porting out resulted in substantial loss of subscribers. Though the actual numbers are still unavailable, some reports suggest that Jio lost about 1.5 lakh customers to Airtel and Vodafone Idea due to protests.
Jio sources say that the first phase was largely competitive in nature, but the current vandalisation is politically-driven. ""We have filed FIRs against the incidents. The response of the local police has been unsatisfactory. We have not been able to restore the connectivity due to threats which is affecting the telecom services,"" says the source. So far, the vandalism is largely restricted to Punjab but there are fears that it might spread to other states as well since the protests are getting support from farmers in other states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and others.
Over a month ago, the farmers started protesting against the new farm law enacted by the current Modi government. Protesting farmers allege that some portions of the law are believed to be favouring large business groups, particularly Reliance Industries (RIL) and Adani Group. The farmers have been making calls to boycott RIL and Adani Group as a result of this perception.

Authorities in Punjab are investigating whether protesting farmers were disrupting power supply to hundreds of telecom towers, a state official said on Monday, amid protests over new farm laws.
""We have told the police to track all those involved in sabotaging the infrastructure,"" a senior official in the Punjab state government told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A senior Punjab state police official said the power supply was disrupted to several telecom towers in the state, mainly ones owned by Jio, the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries.
A source close to Jio said more than 1,400 of its 9,000 plus towers were affected as power supplies and fibre to the towers were cut but could not confirm whether farmers were behind the damage.
Some bundles of Jio's fibre kept for laying were also burnt at one location, the source said, declining to be named as the matter is private.

At least 1,600 towers were affected in total due to the power supply disruption and about 30 towers have been damaged, Tilak Raj Dua, director general of the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA), told Reuters.
Dua said the association was trying to determine which companies were affected and had written to the police in Punjab asking for protection of the towers.
Representatives of two of the 31 farmers' unions protesting against the laws rejected the allegations when contacted by Reuters. They asked to remain unidentified pending a formal statement from all of the unions.
Tens of thousands of farmers are camping out on highways near the capital New Delhi in protest at three new laws implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that they fear will dismantle regulated agricultural markets, threaten their livelihood and benefit large companies.
But Modi and his ministers say the laws will increase farmers' income as it links potential bulk buyers such as WalMart Inc, Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd directly with farmers, bypassing wholesale markets and commission agents.
Punjab's state government is opposed to the new farm laws and a seventh round of talks between farmer unions and federal government officials is scheduled on Tuesday.

Representatives of two of the 31 farmers' unions protesting against the laws rejected the allegations when contacted by Reuters. They asked to remain unidentified pending a formal statement from all of the unions.
Tens of thousands of farmers are camping out on highways near the capital New Delhi in protest at three new laws implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that they fear will dismantle regulated agricultural markets, threaten their livelihood and benefit large companies.
But Modi and his ministers say the laws will increase farmers' income as it links potential bulk buyers such as WalMart Inc, Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd directly with farmers, bypassing wholesale markets and commission agents.
Punjab's state government is opposed to the new farm laws and a seventh round of talks between farmer unions and federal government officials is scheduled on Tuesday.

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator originally developed in 1980 by Donald Lambert and featured in his book Commodities Channel Index: Tools for Trading Cyclical Trends. The commodity channel index is an oscillator used to identify cyclical trends in indices, ETFs, stocks and commodities.
CCI measures the difference between a security's current price change and its average price change. The indicator interpretation is similar to other oscillator indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Being an oscillator indicator, CCI is used as alead indicator for price movement.
This indicator measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time; default period is taken as 20. CCI can be adjusted to the timeframe of the market traded on by changing the averaging period.
Why buy Reliance Industries?

On Monday morning SGX Nifty was hinting at a gap-up start for domestic stock markets. Domestic equity markets enter the last week of this decade on a positive note after having regained almost all losses that they suffered on the previous Monday. Technically, Nifty is still in the negative territory but that could be reversed with a close above the recent highs of 13778. “The short term trend continues to remain down. However, with the intermediate uptrend still intact, we expect the recent correction to be more of a short term nature and may have possibly bottomed out with the strong price action seen in the last three sessions,” said Subash Gangadharan, Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities.
DHFL: Oaktree Capital on Thursday increased its bid for Dewan Housing Finance Corporation by Rs 1,700 crore, taking its total bid price to Rs 38,400 crore making it the highest bidder for the firm. The increased offer came after rival bidder Piramal Capital and Housing Finance had offered to increase its bid for DHFL.

Ambani, still the richest man in Asia, has now dropped down to eleventh position in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after reaching the fourth spot earlier this year.
The Bloomberg list shows Ambani's wealth at $76.5 billion (over Rs 5.63 lakh crore), down from $90 billion (around Rs 6.62 crore) earlier this year. Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, and Larry Ellison, Executive Chairman of Oracle Corporation, held the ninth and tenth positions, respectively, with total net worth of $76.2 billion each.

Amazon chief Jeff Bezos continued to be the richest person in the world with a net worth of $186 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk stood at the second position of Bloomberg Billionaires Index with $160 billion. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was placed third on the list with $131 billion.
With Ambani no longer among the ten richest people, the United States dominated the list. The only exception was French billionaire and LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault, who was on the fourth spot with $110 billion net worth.
Erosion in Ambani's wealth came on the back of correction in Reliance Industries shares, which have fallen as much as 16 per cent from their all-time high of Rs 2,369.35 after the conglomerate entered a Rs 24,713 crore deal with Future Retail to acquire the latter's retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses.

However, the deal faced serious hiccups with Amazon challenging it. The Jeff Bezos-led retail giant claimed that its 2019 investment in Future Coupons had clauses that the Kishore Biyani-led group cannot sell its retail assets to anyone on a retail assets list, which included Reliance Industries.
While the matter is now in court, Reliance Industries shares have seen profit booking on the back of the dispute with Amazon. On Thursday, the scrip closed at 1,993.90, up 50.10 points or 2.58 per cent.
Despite the recent turbulence, RIL shares are 33 per cent higher year till date, creating over Rs 3 lakh crore wealth for investors. This is almost half of the wealth the conglomerate has created for investors over the past 25 years. According to annual Motilal Oswal wealth creation analysis, Reliance has created Rs 6.3 lakh crore investor wealth between 1995 and 2020.

Five companies will end 2020 with ₹5 lakh crore market cap,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/five-companies-will-end-2020-with-5-lakh-crore-market-cap/story-Ywox4grLrJWIOy1yLV2PHL.html,"PUBLISHED ON DEC 26, 2020 03:19 AM IST","India is set to end the year with five companies valued at more than ₹5 lakh crore each as foreign investors pumped a record $18.5 billion into Indian stocks in the December quarter, boosting valuations.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Infosys Ltd entered the ₹5 lakh crore market capitalisation club this year, joining Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd.
Their shares have risen in the range of 9-68% during the year.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries is the most valuable company with a market value of ₹12.64 lakh crore, followed by Tata Consultancy at ₹10.91 lakh crore, HDFC Bank at ₹7.69 lakh crore, Hindustan Unilever at ₹5.63 lakh crore and Infosys at ₹5.26 lakh crore.
Indian stocks plunged more than 20% in March after the nationwide lockdown was announced due to Covid; they have not only recovered the losses but also scaled new highs in November and December.
“The pandemic has created massive opportunities for some businesses. It has created enormous opportunities for pharmaceutical and chemical companies, the technology industry, for offshoring and remotely operating industries,” said analysts at HDFC Securities.
There are at least three other companies that are within striking distance of entering the exclusive club if the market rally sustains in 2021. They include mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. with a market cap of ₹4.44 lakh crore, Kotak Mahindra Bank with a market value of ₹3.88 lakh crore and ICICI Bank at ₹3.54 lakh crore.
Some relatively smaller companies also boosted their market capitalisation during the bull run. For instance, the market cap of Asian Paints gained 48% this year to ₹2.54 lakh crore and is now closing in on cigarette maker ITC Ltd’s ₹2.56 lakh crore market value.
“I would reckon the rise in Asian Paints market cap is the most striking in the large-cap space. Asian Paints trades at FY22 price to earnings at 72 times, while ITC at 17 times. Asian Paints is expected to see ₹3,500 crore profit, while ITC is likely to deliver ₹16,000 crore in FY22. Asian Paints now trades at a premium to Hindustan Unilever and Page Industries,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note to clients. The surge in the equity markets has also helped some of the heavyweight public sector stocks such as NTPC Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. regain the ₹1 lakh crore market-cap mark.
However, the rise in valuations has made analysts cautious. “Valuations are not cheap anymore. However, our view remains constructive on equities as an asset class. India is possibly on a cusp of a new business cycle, which would mean strong growth in corporate earnings and further upgrade in earnings estimates. Consequently, we remain constructive on equities as an asset class and look at every dip as an opportunity to buy,” said Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
“Moreover, there is likely to be strong liquidity support to Indian equity markets. Domestically, most investors are anyway sitting on the fence or have created some cash in their portfolios lately,” it added.

“This has been a short but eventful week with wide gyration in stock prices,” said Rusmik Oza, executive VP and head, Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities.
“Monthly expiry has also contributed to the higher volatility. Nifty’s closing near the previous week high indicates strong rollovers on the back of healthy FII flows seen this month.

Market indices opened on a bullish note for the third consecutive session on Thursday, amid positive global equities. Global equities were buoyed today over an expected stimulus deal in US and focussed on a long-elusive post-Brexit trade agreement between Britain and the European Union, which is expected to be finalised soon.

US equities finished mostly higher as investors monitored the progress of the coronavirus vaccine and the chances of a revived economy in 2021.

DECEMBER 24, 2020, 13:50 IST","Mumbai: Equity benchmark Sensex jumped over 350 points in opening trade on Thursday, tracking gains in index majors Reliance Industries, HDFC twins and ICICI Bank amid positive cues from global markets. The 30-share BSE index was trading 355.23 points or 0.76 per cent higher at 46,799.41, and the broader NSE Nifty surged 109.25 points or 0.80 per cent to 13,710.35.

Decision to approve merger of listed entities and sell retail assets to Reliance Industries is valid: Future Retail,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/decision-to-approve-merger-of-listed-entities-and-sell-retail-assets-to-reliance-industries-is-valid-future-retail/articleshow/79925426.cms,"Last Updated: Dec 24, 2020, 11:31 AM IST","Future Retail NSE -9.98 % (FRL) said its board decision to approve the merger of listed entities and sell retail assets to Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 % is valid according to the recent judgement by Delhi High Court and the entire legal basis of the interim award given by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre is vitiated.

In a statement to the BSE, Kishore Biyani's retail firm said the arbitration agreement is between its promoter entity Future Coupons (FCPL) and Amazon and not with FRL and merging these agreements would violate foreign exchange rules, as per the court order. ""The Hon'ble court held that it is of the prima facie opinion that the conflation of the three agreements - FRL shareholders' agreement (SHA), FCPL SHA, and FCPL share subscription agreement would render the conflated agreement violative of the FEMA FDI rules,"" it said.

On Monday, the Delhi High Court rejected Future Group's plea to prohibit the American giant from interfering in its deal with Reliance Retail and said the statutory authorities are free to take their own decision as per law. The court also held that Amazon's representation to statutory authorities is not wrong but making them based on incorrect assertions makes the act based on unlawful means. It said Future Retail's resolution approving the transaction with Reliance Retail was valid.

""The subject matter of the suit and relief claimed was not related to the enforceability of the emergency Award given by SIAC. Therefore, it cannot be said that this judgment of the Delhi High Court has vitiated the basis of the arbitral award,"" said Ashish K Singh, managing partner, Capstone Legal. ""At best, for the appropriate court, this order will be of persuasive value.""

Reliance Retail Ventures, a unit of Reliance Industries, agreed to buy the retail assets of the Future Group on a slump sale basis for about Rs 25,000 crore, it was announced in August.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has already approved the deal which also requires clearance from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in addition to no objection certificates from creditors and minority shareholders.

""Amazon’s interference, on the basis of the incorrect representation set out above is a civil wrong committed against FRL and Reliance and therefore SEBI cannot take cognizance of this unlawful interference in the freedom of FRL to implement the scheme sanctioned by a valid board resolution in compliance with the statutory provisions and Articles of Association of FRL,"" said the company in its statement.

Amazon, which owns 49% stake in FCPL, a Future Group holding company, objected to the deal and asked regulators to consider the interim order of the SIAC putting the transaction on hold. In its interim order last month, the SIAC had directed the Future Group to put on hold its proposal to sell the retail business to Reliance until it gave a final ruling on the plea filed by Amazon.

Future Retail approached the court with the argument that the company was not a party to the dispute between Future Coupons and Amazon. Hence, the direction was not binding on Future Retail, it had argued."

On the other hand, the recently listed Burger King continued to hit the lower circuit for the second straight session. The scrip plunged around 10 per cent to Rs 161.45.

Overall, the benchmark equity indices extended their gains for the sixth straight session following gains in Infosys, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and Tata Consultancy Services. After opening at its record high of 47,026.02, the BSE Sensex pared some of its gains to close at around 46,961, up 70 points against the previous close of 46,890. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index settled nearly 20 points up at 13,760.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Indian market failed to catch up with the global rally, due to selling in financial stocks which countered gains in IT and pharma sector. The weakness seen in the morning trade got erased a bit as the domestic market absorbed some positivity from European markets to end flat. IT index rallied on news of a buyback offer from TCS. Updates on Brexit deal and US stimulus package are expected to drive the global market in the coming days. FED’s decision to keep rates unchanged will help FIIs to maintain a positive view on emerging markets like India.""

Most active counters
With a total traded quantity of 28.31 crore shares, YES Bank emerged as the most active stock on NSE in terms of volume.

Midcaps, smallcap underperform

Where is Nifty headed?
Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities, said the market has managed to end in the positive zone for the seventh straight week. “Technically, the index still maintains higher bottom series which is broadly positive for the market. For the next few trading session, 13,650 should be the sacrosanct level for the trend following traders. Above the same we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to 13,935-14,000. On the flip side, dismissal of 13,650 could possibly trigger one quick correction leg till 13,500. The larger texture of the market is still into the bullish side, so any short term corrections should be used to add quality IT, Pharma and FMCG stocks with the medium term time horizon,” he added."

RIL and bp are developing three deepwater gas projects in block KG D6 - R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ - which together are expected to meet approximately 15% of India's gas demand by 2023. These projects will utilise the existing hub infrastructure in KG D6 block. RIL is the operator of KG D6 with a 66.67% participating interest and bp holds a 33.33% participating interest.
R Cluster is the first of the three projects to come onstream. The field is located about 60 kilometers from the existing KG D6 Control & Riser Platform (CRP) off the Kakinada coast and comprises a subsea production system tied back to CRP via a subsea pipeline. Located at a water depth of greater than 2000 meters, it is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia. The field is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2021.
Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, added: ""We are proud of our partnership with bp that combines our expertise in commissioning gas projects expeditiously, under some of the most challenging geographical and weather conditions. This is a significant milestone in India's energy landscape, for a cleaner and greener gas-based economy. Through our deep-water infrastructure in the Krishna Godavari basin we expect to produce gas and meet the growing clean energy requirements of the nation.""
The next project, the Satellites Cluster, is expected to come onstream in 2021 followed by the MJ project in 2022.
Peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be around 30 mmscmd (1 bcf/d) by 2023 which is expected to be about 25% of India's domestic production and will help reduce the country's dependence on imported gas.
RIL is India's largest private sector company. Its activities span hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and digital services.
The conglomerate's consolidated net profit fell 6.6% to Rs 10,602 crore on 25.5% decline in net sales to Rs 1,11,236 crore in Q2 September 2020 over Q2 September 2019.
The scrip added 0.36% to Rs 1992.25 on Friday. It traded in the range of 1965 and 2005 so far during the day.

The next project, the Satellites Cluster, is expected to come onstream in 2021 followed by the MJ project in 2022. By 2023 the peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be around 30 mmscmd — about 25% of India’s domestic production. 
R-Field is located about 60 kilometers from the existing KG D6 Control & Riser Platform (CRP) off the Kakinada coast and comprises a subsea production system tied back to CRP via a subsea pipeline. It is at a water depth of more than 2000 meters making it the deepest offshore gas field in Asia. “The field is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2021,” RIL said in a statement.
Production from older fields in the KG-D6 block was stopped in February this year. Operations at R-Field were expected to start earlier this year but were delayed owing to the pandemic.
“Growing India’s own production of cleaner-burning gas to meet a significant portion of its energy demand, these three new KG D6 projects will support the country’s drive to shape and improve its future energy mix,” said Bernard Looney, Chief Executive, BP.

SSS founder Raju Shetti, who has extended support to the agitating farmers gathered at the Delhi borders, alleged that the Centre had enacted the three farm laws for the benefit of industry magnets, including RIL CMD Mukesh Ambani.
“A morcha is being organised from Bandra suburban district collector’s office to the RIL’s office at the Bandra Kurla Complex on December 22. Minister of state Bachhu Kadu and veteran trade union leader Baba Adhav will participate in the morcha. I have appealed to the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) founder Prakash Ambedkar to join the morcha,” said Shetti, who has returned from Delhi after participating in the ongoing protests against the farm laws.
Shetti led a scathing attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre, saying that it was imposing these three farm laws on farmers instead of assuring the minimum support price for the agricultural produce. “Ensure minimum support price to farmers instead of imposing farm laws,” said Shetti. He added that various farmer organisations in Maharashtra are together against the three farm laws.
X
Shetti argued that there is no clarity of the payment of minimum support price to the farmers. As per the provisions of the new laws, farmers will have to sell the agricultural produce to a private buyer, who may pay them a lower price. Moreover, there is no minimum support price in the deal. If a farmer is cheated, he cannot argue his case in the district magistrate’s court.
Shetti made a strong case for making MSP payment mandatory by private buyers to farmers. He suggested that the Contract Farming laws should protect the interest of farmers and not of the private contractors."

RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch alleges ‘nexus’ in retail trade,The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rss-affiliate-swadeshi-jagran-manch-alleges-nexus-in-retail-trade/article33322051.ece,"DECEMBER 13, 2020 22:28 IST","The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) on December 13 demanded that the government not allow a “nexus” of multinational companies and large Indian business houses such as Reliance Industries to dominate the retail industry in the country as it would lead to the exploitation of farmers, kirana store owners, wholesalers and even consumers.
Calling for amendments to the Foreign Direct Investment norms in multi-brand retail to block what it termed as “cunning deals” to circumvent extant restrictions in the policy, the Manch, an affiliate of the RSS, said the government’s response to its repeated complaints about foreign firms violating norms “is not at desirable level”. In a resolution passed on December 13, the SJM also expressed concerns about the amendments to the Essential Commodities Act to lift storage quantity restrictions on all farm products for exporters, super markets and large wholesalers.
Agriculture laws | Government should bring in another Bill or amend current one, says SJM
Stressing that retail is one of the largest employment generating sectors in the country, the resolution said that the “nexus of MNCs and Indian business should not be allowed to operate in India” as it will hurt a very large population working in local kirana stores, small scale suppliers and consumers at large.
Warning over Reliance
The resolution repeatedly referred to the Reliance Industries’ foray into the retail sector and warned that local kirana stores would be transformed into fulfilment centres for Jio Mart and wholesalers converted to warehousing lots for JioMart and Reliance Retail.
Referring to Reliance Retail’s acquisition of Future Group’s retail business and e-pharmacy NetMeds, the resolution stated that chemists will also need to compete with online vendors.
“It is suspected that more than 38% of retail market shall be with Reliance Industries Ltd alone. These developments would result in monopolistic situation where a single party shall not only be able to exploit suppliers and farmers by making purchases at cheaper rates but would also be able to exploit the consumers by offering goods at higher prices in the absence of competition in the market,” the SJM noted.
“The government should examine critically the real impact of such developments on the overall employment in the unorganised retail as well as on the consumers at large. Sale of medicines through e-commerce should not be permitted keeping in view the law of the land and the likely impact on health safety of the population,” the resolution demanded.

On the other hand, Maruti, Nestle India, Titan and PowerGrid were among the gainers. Except for metal, FMCG and realty, all other indices closed in red, with media and PSU banking stocks ending 1% lower.
Retreating from the record highs, most Asian stocks were trading lower early morning as investors kept an eye on Brexit trade talks as well as ongoing negotiations in the US for a coronavirus relief package. US markets closed lower reversing back from day's high as investors booked profits. European markets opened higher as focus remained on the progress of post-Brexit trade talks between UK and EU.  
On markets closing --Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments said,"" After resisting at higher levels, the Nifty took a breather and came down to the lower end of the range which is 13400 but was quick to recover and close above the 13450 level. This rangebound movement between 13400-13700 may continue for a couple of sessions before the market decides on its new course of action and the direction it wishes to pursue. Traders are advised caution; we need to approach this resistance zone meticulously.""
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said,""After five days of bullish rally, the domestic market reversed along with Asian peers, backed by weak global markets, triggering profit booking across major sectors. PSU Banks, small and midcaps which were so positive recently were also under bearish attack. European indices are trading positive ahead of monetary policy announcement by European central bank and UK & EU having decided to finalise the Brexit deal by this Sunday.  A sell-off was seen in the US  tech stocks which led to a correction in the US market as the stimulus package talks dragged. Markets being at the highest level, any unfavourable events, domestic or global, can result in temporary profit booking. However, we believe that the market is optimistic enough to continue the rally post a required consolidation""
Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said,"" Markets ended marginally lower in a range-bound session, taking a breather after the recent surge. Weak global cues led to a gap down opening in the benchmark which further inched lower on the back of profit-taking by the participants.

“Indian benchmark equity indices ran into profit booking on December 10, though they recovered smartly from intra day lows. Stocks were mostly lower Thursday in Asia after weakness in technology companies’ shares led an overnight decline on Wall Street. Bets on more European Central Bank stimulus kept Europe’s main stock markets and the euro steady on Thursday. Nifty after filling the upgap made on Dec 09, has closed at the intra day high. The hitherto performing sectors are undergoing a correction while defensives like FMCG have started to perform.  An upward breach of 13549 could result in resumption of uptrend. Till then doubts will remain as to whether we have made an intermediate top.”
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services –
“After five days of a bullish rally, the domestic market reversed along with Asian peers, backed by weak global markets, triggering profit booking across major sectors. European indices are trading positive ahead of monetary policy announcement by European central bank and UK & EU having decided to finalise the Brexit deal by this Sunday. Markets being at the highest level, any unfavourable events, domestic or global, can result in temporary profit booking. However, we believe that the market is optimistic enough to continue the rally post a required consolidation.”
Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments –
“After resisting at higher levels, the Nifty took a breather and came down to the lower end of the range which is 13400 but was quick to recover and close above the 13450 levels. This rangebound movement between 13400-13700 may continue for a couple of sessions before the market decides on its new course of action and the direction it wishes to pursue. Traders are advised caution; we need to approach this resistance zone meticulously.”

“Markets ended marginally lower in a range-bound session, taking a breather after the recent surge. Weak global cues led to a gap down opening in the benchmark which further inched lower on the back of profit-taking by the participants. Indications are in the favour of some consolidation in the index and it would be healthy for the markets. Nifty has critical support at 13,350 and its breakdown may result in further correction ahead. In the case of a rebound, the 13,550-13,600 zone would act as a hurdle. Defensive viz.

Manish Shah Founder Niftytriggers –
“The momentum in Nifty is still strong despite international markets showing a loss of strength in last couple of days. Nifty holds below the monthly pivot of 13591 Once it manages to trade above 13590-13600 we can expect a rally towards 13776-13800 before the end of the current expiry. Nifty is currently showing overbought readings on oscillators and it is also just a tad below the rising channel line. There are no tell-tale signs of a reversal and as long as Nifty remains above 13350 the underlying remains bullish. A break above 13600 should see the market rallying to 13776-13800.”

Here's how much Tesla's Elon Musk owns in bitcoin now from only 0.25 BTC back in 2018
More than 75% of the BSE100 performance in FY21 so far has come from 24 stocks. In contrast, the same magnitude of returns were contributed by just five stocks in FY19 and six in FY18.
“Normalisation of economic activity continues, but second wave of Covid-19 poses near-term challenges even with hopes of vaccine turning into reality,” said ICICI Securities in a strategy note, adding limited high-frequency data for the month of November 2020 so far indicated that month-on-month growth continued although the momentum lost some steam.
The BSE100 index, which boasts of about 70% of the combined market capitalisation of BSE has surged over 57% in FY21, with all constituents trading in the green.While heavyweight RIL accounted for 12.5% of the index gain, HDFC Bank, Infosys and ICICI Bank, among them added another 23%, Bloomberg’s data show. The combined weight of 24 stocks that contributed 75% to the index gains stands 65.6%.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continue to purchase Indian shares even as the domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remain net sellers. Between November 1 and now, the FPIs have bought shares worth $11.9 billion taking their year-to-date purchases to $18.4 billion — the highest since 2013. On the other hand, local investors, including mutual funds, have offloaded shares valued $8.1 billion since November, Bloomberg data showed.
After two successive years of negative returns, the broad-based indices — BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap — have outdone the benchmark Sensex in 2020. While the BSE Smallcap index has returned 28.3%, which is more than double of Sensex’s returns at 11.8%, the gauge for midcap stocks surged 17.6% between January and now. Nevertheless, the rally in stocks has stretched valuations further.
“Market valuations continue to turn expensive – it is now above +1 standard deviation on cyclically adjusted PE ratio, while on the trailing and forward P/E it was already above +1 s.d”, says ICICI Securities.

HOMEMARKETSNearly A Quarter Of Companies Contribute More Than 75% To BSE100 Gains"
"IMC 2020: Jio says 5G ready, COAI says industry not ready yet",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/imc-2020-jio-says-5g-ready-coai-says-industry-not-ready-yet/articleshow/79645838.cms,"Last Updated: Dec 09, 2020, 06:50 PM IST","New Delhi: Reliance Jio and the telecom operators’ industry body were on opposite camps in terms of readiness for 5G at an industry event on Wednesday.

Speaking during a panel discussion at the India Mobile Congress on Wednesday, Sunil Dutt, president (devices) at Jio, the only profit-making telco in India, stressed that the company was fully prepared in various aspects for 5G - from devices to network.

But SP Kochhar, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), of which Jio is also a member, pointed out the poor financial health of its other two members Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, adding that operators have to weigh in the use cases for 5G in rural areas before investing huge capital to generate a meaningful return.

The divergent views mirrored the comments of Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Jio’s parent Reliance Industries who spoke on Tuesday about the telco being ready to bring in 5G in the second half of 2021. Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, though had called 5G an upcoming technology” and said that it would start to be widely adopted in India in two to three years.

“If there is one digital company which is prepared, I think it is we who are prepared for 5G,” Dutt said during the India Mobile Congress being held virtually. “Reliance as an organisation will step in as we have done in the past as well with 4G, where benefits of connectivity were made far more affordable through our JioPhones, so far to 100 million people.”

He added that it is now critical to migrate the massive 2G and 3G base of 400 million users to 5G in the same fashion.

“We are going to be there to support customers not only in terms of mobile handhelds but other connected homes, connected enterprise, connected education. I think we are all set for it,” he said.

But Kochhar said financials is the key determinant of 5G besides use cases, network, spectrum, and devices.

“5G is not an upgrade, it’s completely a new technology hence it would require a huge capital infusion but currently, operators are already bleeding,” he said.

Government must also look at facilitating telcos and original equipment makers (OEMs) who are investing huge capital in networks and manufacturing and make spectrum available at affordable pricing, Kochhar said.

Device makers like Realme and chipset designers like Mediatek said that with 5G already being adopted globally, they are ready with the ecosystem to democratise – or facilitate wider adoption - 5G in India.

“We will ensure to bring more and more hardware and democratise 5G as much as we can at a most affordable pricing, without compromising on any of the hardware specs,” Madhav Sheth, CEO, Realme said in the discussion.

The pandemic has transferred user behavior who are more than ever dependent on connected devices, especially the new user base emerging from the younger population, said Anku Jain, MD, MediaTek."

Indian Bank climbs 5%

The scrip settled 4.73 per cent higher at Rs 89.65.

""The rating upgrade factors in improvement in capitalisation ratios of the bank, strong shareholder base and experienced board members,"" the agency said. YES Bank settled 9.98 per cent up at Rs 19.06 on the BSE.

MTNL rallies
Shares of MTNL climbed over 6 per cent after the company said it would on December 31 seek shareholders' nod to raise Rs 2,138.6 crore as part of sovereign guarantee bond. The scrip settled 6.21 per cent higher at Rs 10.78.

Where is Nifty headed?
Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said Nifty’s daily Bollinger Bands have started to expand, which is favourable for the trending move. Therefore, the index is expected to stay on an upward trajectory.

“The Nifty is inching towards its short term target of 13,700. The price action over the last few sessions shows that on the occasions of minor degree dips, the 20 hour moving average has been acting as a cushion. At present, the average is near at 13,400 and it is likely to continue with its role as a near term support,” he added."

“Market is effortlessly rallying to a new high on a daily basis, with all the sectors contributing in the bull run. The Indian rupee is strongly moving ahead against the USD, as the dollar is attracted to domestic developments, providing an edge compared to other Asian peers. Small and Microcaps are hugely outperforming the market, and the euphoria is expected to stay in the short to medium-term. Hopes of vaccine and stimulus packages in India and developed nations are raising the spirit of equity market.”
Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments –
“We closed very close to the day’s high which is a good sign. The Nifty has a strong bullish under current and every dip can be looked at as a buying opportunity. However, traders should be cautious as we are in a range of resistance which is between 13400 and 13700. We are now closer to the upper end of this range. A strong support lies at 13100.”
Abhishek Chinchalkar, CMT Charterholder and Head of Education, FYERS –
“Indian markets have hit yet another milestone today, with Sensex crossing the 46000 mark and Nifty moving above 13500. While the overall trend continues to be bullish, one needs to now adopt a cautious stance given how steep the advance has got in the past several sessions. Hence, we would suggest short-term traders who are already holding long positions in the market to tighten their stop losses and look out for profit-booking opportunities. Meanwhile, for those looking to create new long positions, we would suggest waiting for a minor correction, before entering on the long side.”
Ajit Mishra, VP – Research, Religare Broking –
“Markets traded upbeat for yet another session and gained over a percent, driven by positive global cues and more announcements on the stimulus package. Markets are largely mirroring global cues but the benchmark looks slightly overbought so the possibility of consolidation in the near term cannot be ruled out and it would be healthy for markets. We thus recommend booking partial profit in the existing trades and keep trailing stop losses on every rise. For fresh buying, investors should maintain extra caution on the selection of stocks and maintain “buy on dips” approach.”
Manish Shah Founder Niftytriggers –
“Nifty had a field day as it rallied by 136 points over the close of the previous day. The index heavy weights participated in the rally as both HDFC Bank and Reliance were among the gainers for the day. The momentum is strong and there are no signs of a reversal. Nifty also opened the day with a gap and one question that is raised that is this an exhaustion gap that we are seeing. A trend in motion remains in motion till the time it reverses and we do see reversal signals as yet. The fact remains that Nifty is overextended and sooner or later it will revert to the mean. If there are any signs of a reversal it could be an opportunity to buy.”

After touching a record intra-day high of 45,908.08, the 30-share BSE index was trading 285.62 points or 0.63% higher at 45,894.13.
Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 78.25 points or 0.58% to 13,471.20. It touched its lifetime intra-day peak of 13,475.05 in early trade.
ITC was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 2%, followed by ONGC, TCS, Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, HCL Tech, Bajaj Finserv and NTPC.

Binod Modi, Head-Strategy at Reliance Securities, said domestic markets saw a gap-up opening on Wednesday taking cues from positive global markets.
“Persistent FPI flow remains a dominant factor for the markets. Given strong visibility of sustained earnings growth in 2HFY21 led by continued traction in business activities for many sectors, markets are likely to remain buoyant.
“However, high valuations of markets will continue to pose a risk. We believe midcap and small cap stock may continue to see traction in the near term,” he said.
U.S. equities finished higher with key indices recording new highs mainly on satisfactory progress on vaccine approvals and distribution, he added.
Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo were trading on a positive note in mid-session deals.
Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude futures were trading 0.51% lower at $48.59 per barrel."

Mukesh Ambani calls for policy steps for early roll out of 5G,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/mukesh-ambani-calls-for-policy-steps-for-early-roll-out-of-5g,": Wednesday, December 9, 2020, 12:25 AM IST","Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Tuesday said there was a requirement of policy measures for the early roll out of the fifth generation (5G) connectivity technology.
Addressing the inaugural session of India Mobile Congress (IMC), Ambani said Reliance Jio will pioneer India's '5G Revolution' in the second half of 2021.
He noted that India was among the best digitally-connected nations in the world right now.
""In order to maintain this lead, policy steps are needed to accelerate early rollout of 5G, and to make it affordable and available everywhere,"" the RIL Chairman said.
He said that Jio's 5G services will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components, adding that Jio's 5G operations ""will be a testimony to your inspiring vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' or a self-reliant India.
He exuded confidence that the much-anticipated 5G will enable India to lead the ""fourth industrial revolution"" globally.
""Jio Platforms, with its family of over 20 start-up partners, has built world-class capabilities in Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Blockchain, etc. We are creating compelling home-grown solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture, infrastructure, financial services and new commerce,"" Ambani said.
He said Jio will offer these solutions and services to the rest of the world to address global challenges, after they are proven in India.
The RIL Chairman who caused a ripple in India's telecom industry with the introduction of low-cost 4G services with Jio reiterated his stand that 2G should be phased out with a view to provide more benefits to all telecom users, including the low-income groups.
""As many as 300 million mobile subscribers in India are still trapped in the 2G era. Urgent policy steps are needed to ensure that these underprivileged people have an affordable smartphone so that they too can benefit from Direct Benefit Transfer into their bank accounts, and actively participate in the digital economy."""
Mukesh Ambani starts new chapter in Indian telecom story,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/telecom/mukesh-ambani-starts-new-chapter-in-indian-telecom-story/story/424286.html,"Manu Kaushik | December 8, 2020 | Updated 23:23 IST","The countdown for the next big thing in the telecom sector has begun. At the fourth edition of the India Mobile Congress (IMC), which is being held virtually this year due to the pandemic, Reliance Industries' (RIL) Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani decided to set the agenda for the domestic telecom sector - at least for the next one year.
ADVERTISING
In his speech on the first day of the three-day conference, Ambani said that his telecom venture, Reliance Jio will pioneer the 5G revolution in India in the second half of 2021. ""It will be powered by indigenously developed network, hardware and technology components,"" Ambani added.
To introduce 5G in India, Ambani needs two things - spectrum to be made available to telcos, and 5G-ready infrastructure. The first aspect is beyond his control, but there is strong likelihood of government conducting 5G spectrum auctions early next year.

As far as 5G infrastructure is concerned, Jio has been working on that piece for quite some time. As Ambani mentioned in RIL's last annual general meeting (AGM) held in July, Jio is building its own 5G solutions, including hardware and software, through which it plans to compete with Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia and other proprietary telecom vendors. Ambani had also said that Jio will not only deploy these 5G equipment in its network but will also export them.
""Jio's 5G service will be a testimony to your inspiring vision of AtmaNirbhar Bharat. I can say with utmost confidence that 5G will enable India to not only participate in the fourth industrial revolution but also to lead it. Jio Platforms, with its family of over 20 start-up partners, has built world-class capabilities in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, internet of things, blockchain, etc,"" Ambani said at IMC today.
To elaborate, Jio has taken the O-RAN route to build its 5G solutions under which some components will be sourced from specialised vendors (like Qualcomm, Samsung, etc) while others are going to be developed in-house. Jio, for instance, acquired US-based Radisys in 2018 to build capabilities in system integration and network virtualisation.
ALSO READ: RIL share rises 2% on plan to launch 5G in second half of 2021
However, deployment of O-RAN networks is still in nascent stage globally, and experts believe that Jio would require proprietary vendors for its telecom equipment needs, given its size (over 400 million subscribers, pan-India coverage).
Also, the fact that Jio has partnered with Google to develop cheap 5G smartphones shows that it's working on the back-end (equipment, software) and front-end (handsets) simultaneously so that by the time 5G services are rolled out, the end consumers would have affordable device in their hands. As per IDC, the average selling price (ASP) of 5G smartphone is expected to be $611 (Rs 45,000) in 2020 whereas Jio's smartphone is expected to cost under Rs 5,000.
Even as Ambani has announced a shorter deadline to launch 5G, his competitor Sunil Mittal, Chairman of Airtel, said at IMC 2020 that India will be ready for 5G in the next two-three years. From the time India aspired to take lead in the global 5G race, it's now believed that India should wait to deploy the next-generation of telecom technology since a delayed launch would help domestic telcos to learn from the mistakes of others.

Previously, Jio had revealed it had set up core architecture and was ready to switch to 5G as soon as the spectrum auction came around. Here is everything you need to know about Jio 5G.
Mukesh Ambani had announced in July that Jio would start testing its homegrown 5G solution as soon as the spectrum was available. The announcement was made during RIL’s 43rd Annual General Meeting.
At the Qualcomm 5G Summit in October, Jio had announced the development of its 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) designed to test 5G network at scale.
Jio has been working with companies like Samsung and Qualcomm to bring 5G to India.
“I assure you that Jio will pioneer the 5G revolution in India in the second half of 2021. It will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components. Jio’s 5G service will be a testimony to your inspiring vision of Atma-Nirbhar Bharat,” Ambani said on Tuesday.
Ambani further said that urgent policy steps were needed to ensure underprivileged people in India, those who were still trapped in the 2G era, had access to an affordable smartphone.
Jio had formally announced the launch of Jio 4G services in India in September 2016.
Jio 4G services with free access to unlimited data and voice calls were available to all starting from September 5, up to December 31, 2016. It is too early to comment on how exactly Jio would go about rolling out 5G services in India, and whether, these services would be free for all initially like Jio 4G, but Tuesday’s announcement is crucial because until now, 5G was a distant pipe dream. Now we have a tentative timeline as to when we can expect 5G in India. Whether or not Jio is able to stick to this timeframe is something that only time would tell.
Meanwhile, Reliance Industries Limited is also simultaneously working with Google on low-cost smartphones running a localised version of Android software. Though concrete details are still unknown, Ambani had talked about 4G, even 5G smartphones costing a fraction of their current cost with deep emphasis on a value-engineered smartphone operating system designed specifically for the Indian market during RIL’s 43rd AGM.

The RIL chairman added that there will be a ""more equal India... with increased incomes, increased employment, and improved quality of life for 1 billion Indians at the middle and bottom of the economic pyramid.""

""Throughout 2020, India worked online, studied online, shopped online, received healthcare online, socialised online, played online..., simply put, India thrived online,"" he noted underscoring the ""phenomenal"" evolution of digital technology in India.
Presenting four key ideas to further push the country's digital mission, Ambani said: -
1. As many as 300 million mobile subscribers in India are still trapped in 2G era
Highlighting this as an impediment in the government's digital push, Ambani pointed out that the Centre needs to take urgent policy steps to ensure that ""underprivileged people have an affordable smartphone"" in order for them to benefit from Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) into their bank accounts, and actively participate in the digital economy.
2. India is today among the best digitally connected nations in the world
In order to maintain this lead, the RIL chairman said that policy steps are needed to ""accelerate early rollout of 5G"" making it affordable and available everywhere. Assuring the government that Reliance Jio will ""pioneer"" the 5G revolution in India, implementing the service in the second half of 2021, Ambani said that it will be powered by ""indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components.""

Each of these solutions, Ambani said, once proven in India, will be offered to the rest of the world to address global challenges.
4. As the digitalisation of the Indian economy and Indian society picks up speed, demand for digital hardware will grow enormously
Talking about the demand for digital hardware, which is poised to grow staggeringly, the RIL chairman asserted that the country ""can't rely on large-scale imports"" in this area of ""critical national need."" Thanking the government's ""focussed efforts"", many global companies, Ambani said, are coming to India to set up manufacturing facilities and that the country has developed world-class strengths in chip design. Foreseeing India becoming a major hub for the state-of-the-art semiconductor industry, the RIL chairman said that, the country's success in hardware can match its accomplishment in software when all stakeholders work together.

He further said that Reliance Jio will be powered by the indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components. “Jio’s 5G service will be a testimony to the inspiring vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” Ambani said.

Mukesh Ambani said that even as COVID-19 pandemic posed life-threatening challenges, the high-speed 4G connectivity infrastructure has proved to be India’s digital lifeline. Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mukesh Ambani said that the Digital India Mission has made the country highly resilient in the face of the toughest of adversities. RIL chief said that throughout 2020, India thrived online, as people worked, studied, shopped, received healthcare, socialised and played online.
Reliance Jio is creating home-grown solutions in Education, Healthcare, Agriculture, Infrastructure, Financial Services and New Commerce, he said. “Each of these solutions, once proven in India, will be offered to the rest of the world to address global challenges,” he added.

HOMEINDUSTRYHow To Bring 30 Crore Trapped 2G Users To 5G Mukesh Ambani Promises Revolution Next Year"
Reliance Industries up 3% on 5G plans; sees rollout in second half of 2021,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/reliance-industries-up-3-on-5g-plans-sees-rollout-in-second-half-of-2021-120120800435_1.html,"Last Updated at December 8, 2020 11:54 IST","Shares of Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries advanced nearly 3 per cent to Rs 2,014 on the BSE in the intra-day deals on Tuesday after the chairman of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate said the company plans to launch 5G services in the second half of 2021.
Speaking at India Mobile Congress 2020, Ambani said policy steps are needed to accelerate an early rollout of 5G, and to make it affordable and available everywhere.
""I assure you that Jio will pioneer the 5G Revolution in India in the second half of 2021. It will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components. Jio's 5G service will be a testimony to your inspiring vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat,"" he said. READ ABOUT IT HERE
He also pitched for policy interventions to bring smartphones to 300 million 2G phone users in India so that they can also benefit from digital transformations.
Early this year, Mukesh Ambani had announced Reliance Jio's commercial pact with Google to jointly develop entry-level affordable 4G and possibly 5G smartphones for a '2G mukt Bharat' (free of 2G India) in the future.

""We believe we can design an entry-level 4G or even 5G smartphone for a fraction of its current cost. To power such a value-engineered smartphone, we also need an equally value-engineered operating system, and such an operating system must be designed from grounds-up,” Ambani had said at the company's 43rd Annual General Meeting this year.
Reliance Jio's emphasis on 5G and driving subscribers away from the 2G network indicate a shift in strategy from price-led differentiation to service-led differentiation. This, analysts at Jefferies said, bodes well for the sector's pricing environment.
""While we expect 5G spectrum to be auctioned next year with operators only buying it the year after that to lower its exorbitant $7 billion price, Reliance's move on 5G could result in an earlier than expected 5G capex cycle, which would impact the FCF and ROCE profile of the sector, but accelerate market share shifts towards companies with stronger balance sheets,"" it had said in a post AGM company update.
At 11:40 am, the stock of RIL was ruling 1.7 per cent higher at Rs 1,993 per share relative to a 0.08-per cent rise in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex. A combined 12.8 million shares had changed hands on the counter on the NSE and BSE till the time of writing of this report."

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has witnessed a huge transformation from an energy giant to becoming a market leader in digital and retail space. Research and brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes that with the changing global energy landscape and various developments in the post COVID-19 world, RIL’s standalone business is in the spotlight owing to its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business. The brokerage firm has recommended to ‘buy’ RIL shares and given a target price of Rs 2,240, implying an upside of nearly 15 per cent from the previous close.

RIL shares were trading 2.45 per cent higher at Rs 2,006 apiece on Tuesday morning, as compared to a 0.59 per cent rise in S&P BSE Sensex in the morning deals. The petrochemicals sector will account for 60 per cent of global oil demand over the next decade (replacing the share enjoyed by the transportation sector at 60 per cent in the last decade) owing to plateauing of oil demand expected from 2030, according to the International Energy Agency’s outlook. The report highlighted that refining margin continues to face recovery delays owing to further lockdowns in certain parts of the world, petchem margin is at multi-year highs.
15% correction
RIL stock price has witnessed a correction of 15 per cent from its peak. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal says that this could be a good investment candidate on the back of a revival in commodities. Moreover, as RIL has attained a dominant position in both digital services and organized retailing, it believes that further integration of its O2C business would unlock the huge potential upside from the standalone business as well.
For RIL, the ‘oil-to-chemicals’ conversion stands at 24 per cent. “Increase in O2C conversion would wean it away from an already flooded global refining industry,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. It further added that O2C is a tool for the company to offset poor refining margin in a way that OMCs use marketing margin to compensate for poor GRMs.
Massive fundraising
After the company reorganised Reliance Jio’s balance sheet at the start of the calendar year 2020, RIL has raised Rs 2.5 lakh crore by selling 34 per cent stake in Reliance Jio for Rs 1.52 lakh crore, 8 per cent stake in Reliance Retail for Rs 37,700 crore), and JV rights to BP for Rs 7,600 crore, along with a rights issue of Rs 53,100 crore.

Motilal Oswal noted that RIL further plans to streamline its O2C integration business and focus on expanding its fuel marketing business. The brokerage firm has valued the refining and petrochemical segment of the company at 7.5x to arrive at a valuation of Rs 713 per share for the standalone business. “We ascribe an equity valuation of Rs 900 per share to RJio and Rs 627 per share to Reliance Retail,” it said.

"New e-bidding norms: Reliance, others don’t need government nod for gas pricing",Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/new-e-bidding-norms-reliance-others-dont-need-government-nod-for-gas-pricing,": Tuesday, December 8, 2020, 12:26 AM IST","Reliance Industries and other producers of natural gas will no longer need the government approval for the gas price if it is arrived at using the new guidelines for the discovery of market price, an official order said.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas last week notified guidelines for the discovery of market prices for domestically produced natural gas through e-bidding.
The government has since 2017 given pricing freedom for natural gas produced from all fields other than the old fields of state-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd in nomination blocks.
X
Firms such as Reliance Industries-BP combine as well as ONGC (for non-nomination blocks) have been auctioning gas to users. They would typically devise a formula and seek bids from users.
They will continue to devise a pricing formula, but will now have to seek bids on the electronic-platform of five pre-selected agencies, the notification said.
The agencies are SBI Capital Markets Ltd, mjunction Services Ltd, RITES, MSTC and CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solution Ltd.
This follows the Union Cabinet in October allowing marketing freedom for blocks where pricing freedom already existed. Alongside, it approved standardised bidding for price discovery.
The companies ""shall design the tender/ bid offer, including the eligibility criteria, bid parameters, evaluation criteria, tender fee, salient terms and conditions of Gas Sales Agreement and any other relevant information etc, with a view to encourage wider participation from prospective buyers, promote competition and maximise the value of natural gas offered,"" it said.
ONGC and OIL are also to follow these guidelines for the discovery of the market price of natural gas produced from their fields wherever pricing and marketing freedom has been granted, the order said.
""The existing gas sales agreements, made in connection with contract provisions, would continue till the duration of the agreements/contracts and thereafter subsequent sale of gas shall be subject to these guidelines,"" it added.
Reliance and its partner BP have sold initial 5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from their second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block for five years.
ONGC too has sold initial gas from the neighbouring KG-D5 block.
The two will use the new guidelines whenever the existing contracts expire or they have additional quantities of gas to offer.
The order said the companies must ensure at least 21 days' time for bidding.
They have to submit to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) details of the auction such as a list of participants, qualified bidders and selected bidders with their price and quantity allocated.
""The entire proceeding will be conducted by the contractor/producer without any need for the approval of the government,"" the order said. ""The government, however, will have the right to ask for information and intervene if there are reasons to believe that there is foul play."" The companies have to invite bids from prospective buyers of natural gas through an e-bidding portal, it said.
""National oil companies, viz ONZC and OIL shall also follow the guidelines for the discovery of market price of natural gas produced from their nomination fields wherever pricing and marketing freedom has been granted,"" it said.
While the price of gas produced from nomination fields is dictated by the government, ONGC and OIL have the freedom to sell gas from difficult fields such as deepsea."

Here, he tells BrandSutra about marketing lessons from his career, acing the lockdown to register robust growth and his constant quest for knowledge
Tell us about a few extraordinary on-ground experiences from your 25-year career, that have gone on to become marketing lessons.
I have been involved in various aspects of business, including initiating and putting in place new out-of-the-box strategies that consistently inspire teams to generate record revenues, and this is only because I enjoy learning, scratching below the surface and gauging the ground realities as well as getting into the heads of my customers to understand what compels them to buy a particular product. I have learnt that in addition to business knowledge and understanding ground realities, it is passion, empathy, and adaptability that catapult one towards success. Many extraordinary on-ground experiences in planning and execution have helped me become a better marketer. For example, in this organisation itself, when we were struggling to establish ourselves as an appliances brand in the retail space till 2015, the planning and organising experiential demo kit installations in retail stores helped us grow the single category sales 6X. We simultaneously worked on creating a team of in-shop demonstrators for the products to enhance the shopping experience for customers.

What is the biggest business challenge that you have faced at any point in your career, and how did you overcome it? Tell us the story.
I have had my fair share of challenges during my career and learnt early on that being adaptable builds resilience, which is a key to clearing roadblocks in one's path. The challenges I faced when I joined Usha was low penetration of the specialty store format, hypermarket format and online channels. In the last five years, we have worked relentlessly towards increasing our footprint in speciality stores, hypermarkets, modern and regional retail channels and online platforms.
The other challenge was that in most of the speciality stores and hypermarket formats, they did not have the complete range of Usha products in their portfolio. By sharing business insights, industry growth perspective, and consumer case studies, we have been able to ensure that the Usha product portfolio is listed in its entirety in their overall business.
How did COVID-19 affect Usha International? What kind of shift do you expect or see in consumer behaviour, going by the retail experience?
In Usha's Retail business, the COVID-19 period has helped us further strengthen our processes and work towards operational efficiencies. In terms of consumer behaviour, we have seen less footfalls in stores and more consumers on online platforms. Due to high penetration of the Internet and its accelerated adoption during the lockdown, we have focused on creating the same retail experience for consumers and offering online platforms like brand stores, and A+ content, etc. Presently, we are delighted to report that sales have not only returned to pre-COVID levels, but we have also grown on a YoY and MoM comparison. In November 2020, the retail sales numbers have surpassed expectations by recording a YoY growth of 45% in sell-in and 115% growth in sell-out. A major shift in terms of consumer behaviour is the rapid acceleration towards Digital. The need of the hour now is to find a strategic balance between offline and online channels of sales.
What next from the domestic and international Retail business of Usha? What are your plans?
We have always kept our brand values at the forefront of all our initiatives and will continue to do so, under-pinning our commitment towards our consumers. Throughout this year, Usha has been continuously innovating and revamping operations to stay relevant, and focusing on consumer needs and preferences. This has in turn helped us clock a double-digit growth, a trend we expect to continue in the coming months. We are now back to business as usual, and our expansion strategy is under way. We have made the required investments for expanding our retail footprint across platforms and retail formats across India. We are also strengthening our display and assortment along storefronts so that consumers can explore the display from outside without the need of stepping inside the retail outlet.
What is the one thing that motivates you when you wake up each day? Name a quality that you feel a marketer should absolutely possess.
One thing that motivates me every day is my quest to gain knowledge either through reading books, learning from my own experiences, or learning from peers. The passion to do my very best in every aspect of life also motivates me. The joy of learning, understanding people's mindset and what makes them tick, and how I can fulfill their needs to the best of my ability, while growing the business, is an intrinsic part of my life, and has been for over two decades. Challenging myself to find better ways of working, empowering and motivating teams, tracking the dynamic sales trends and analysing consumer preferences, is what keeps me ticking. One quality a marketer should absolutely possess is dynamism. Adaptability and agility are also necessary for a marketer, as is empathy and emotional intelligence for a leader – this year has reiterated that more than ever."
"RIL’s profits from SEZ not taxable, company can claim deductions: ITAT",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rils-profits-from-sez-not-taxable-company-can-claim-deductions-itat/articleshow/79564742.cms,"Last Updated: Dec 04, 2020, 03:45 PM IST","Mumbai: Profit made by a company in a Special Economic Zone, is not taxable under different sections of the income tax act, and companies can avail them both together, a Mumbai bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled.

The ITAT was ruling in the case of Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 % Limited (RIL) and the issue of taxability of company’s profits from SEZ. As per the details of the case RIL had claimed deductions under two sections of the income tax act. The tax department had challenged this and the matter had reached ITAT Mumbai.

The company had made profits from its refinery located in Moti Khavdi SEZ. RIL had claimed deductions of Rs 7530 crore under section 10AA of the income tax act. The act deals with the profits made from SEZ units. The company had claimed tax deductions of the remaining profit—Rs 698 crore under a separate section—section 80 IB (9) of the income tax act. This section deals with tax exemptions or deductions for certain industrial units in infrastructure sector.

“Deduction under section 10AA can be computed based on the gross profit gains or commercial profits made from an SEZ. This is not based on income computed on business gains or taxable profits. Simultaneous deductions under 80 IB (9) by the taxpayer can be claimed for balance profits which are not allowed under the earlier section,” a Dhruva Advisors tax research note said.

The tax department had argued that Rs 698 crore should be taxable and the exemption should be disallowed.

“The decision of the ITAT allowing deduction under section 10AA based on gross profit is path breaking. Taxpayers should certainly evaluate the possibility of making a claim for additional deduction under section 10AA of the act especially before 2018/19. And from 2018/19 onwards there may still be some possibility that despite the explanation to the section 10AA(1) claim of deduction on the basis of commercial profits could be merited,” the Dhruva Advisors research note read."
Future-Reliance deal: Sebi awaits clarification before go-ahead,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/future-reliance-deal-sebi-awaits-clarification-before-go-ahead,": Thursday, December 3, 2020, 10:05 PM IST","Markets regulator Sebi has sought some ""clarification"" from leading stock exchange BSE before giving its go-ahead to the Rs 24,713 crore deal between Future group and Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd.
In an update on November 27, the regulator said it is awaiting a reply to the ""clarification"" sought from the stock exchange on the draft composite scheme of arrangement between Future Group companies and Reliance Group companies.
When contacted, a BSE spokesperson on Thursday said, ""in the draft composite scheme of arrangement between Future Group and Reliance Group till date Sebi has not sought any clarification from BSE with regard to the NOC"".
The bourse gave its NOC (No Objection Certificate) for the scheme on November 6.
Scheme of arrangement is a court-approved agreement between a company and its shareholders or creditors.
According to sources, there are certain complaints registered on Sebi's SCORES platform which are yet to be resolved and the awaited clarification may be related to those pending complaints rather than specifically about the deal.
The markets watchdog has sought clarification from the exchange on the unresolved investors complaints registered on SCORES, they added.
Resolution of pending investor complaints is required before regulatory approvals.
In August, Reliance Industries announced acquisition of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore to bolster its fast growing retail business.
E-commerce major Amazon has opposed the deal.
Earlier, Amazon had written to Sebi and stock exchanges, urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator's interim judgement that put on hold the deal between Future group and Reliance Industries while reviewing the proposed transaction.
Under the proposed deal, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), subsidiary of Reliance Industries, will acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business of Future Group.
In November, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the proposed deal.
Last year, Amazon bought 49 per cent stake in one of Future Group's unlisted firms, with the right to buy into the listed flagship Future Retail Ltd.
Amazon has claimed that its contract with the unlisted Future Coupons Ltd barred a transaction with a number of persons and companies, including Reliance."

According to a November 27 notification issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) that sought an explanation from BSE, the country’s oldest exchange gave its no-objection certificate to the Future Group companies on November 6. Rival National Stock Exchange hasn’t cleared Future Group’s scheme of amalgamation.
“There are four complaints against Future Group companies and the (RIL) deal, which are registered under Sebi’s Scores mechanism. The regulator has sought clarification from the designate exchanges on these unresolved complaints,” a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. Investor complaints against publicly traded firms and intermediaries are registered through the Scores online platform.
Spokespersons for BSE and NSE declined to comment on the matter, citing the sensitivity of the issue. Amazon has written two letters to Sebi and the stock exchanges, urging the regulators not to clear the deal since it would disregard the Singapore International Arbitration Centre’s (SIAC) interim award, which has blocked Future Group from selling any assets or take any step in this direction until a final verdict is pronounced by the arbitration court.
Amazon has said that Future Group has misled public investors through false information and breached corporate governance norms, allegations that have been denied by the Indian firm. Amazon has told Sebi that if the regulator approves the RIL-Future deal, it will not only mean disrespect for the SIAC but will also be detrimental to the interest of public shareholders and discourage foreign companies from forging alliances with local firms. Future Retail has filed a counter lawsuit against Amazon in the Delhi high court to stop it from blocking the deal.
Six Future Group firms—Future Consumer Ltd, Future Enterprises Ltd, Future Market Networks Ltd, Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd, Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd and Future Retail—submitted their draft schemes of arrangement on October 7 to BSE, as the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group moved to consummate the ₹24,713 crore asset sale agreement with RIL.
Amazon has claimed that a 2019 stake purchase agreement with an unlisted Future Group company bars the latter from selling a stake in Future Retail without its consent. Amazon bought a 49% stake in Future Coupons Pvt. Ltd, which then acquired a 7.3% stake in Future Retail. The agreement also gave Amazon the right to increase its stake in Future Retail in the future.
But the lockdown triggered a crisis at the Future Group, forcing it to enter into an agreement with RIL to sell its retail, wholesale and logistics assets. The deal was announced on August 29.

According to the closing share price on November 27, the total MCap of 18 Tata companies stood at  Rs 14,50,502 crore ($196.11 billion), thanks to the recent spike in share prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Titan, Tata Consumer Products among others.

The four listed companies of HDFC group jointly enjoy MCap of Rs 13,84,118 crore ($187.14 billion). Market experts predict HDFC group companies scale up value faster as Bank Nifty has gained momentum lately in November.
Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries (RIL) was the first company to reach the $200 billion MCap in September. However, RIL fell almost 17 per cent since it touched the peak. RIL and its listed subsidiary companies are jointly valued in the market at Rs 12,38,467 crore ($167.45 billion). The total value of promoter holding stood at Rs 6,28,819 crore ($85 billion) - 32 per cent lower compared to the value of promoter holding in Tata group. RIL is the major contributor to Ambani's wealth with a MCap Rs 12,23,417 crore, which has more than doubled in this financial year, thanks to large scale fundraising in Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures through stake sales.
Another Indian business house, which has seen a fast appreciation of share prices of its group companies in the recent past, is Adani.

Adani Group, which has six major listed companies, has a total MCap of Rs 3,97,459 crore. The total value of promoter holding jumped to Rs 2,88,303 crore.
However, the Bajajs are still ahead of Adanis. Veteran industrialist Rahul Bajaj headed Bajaj group's top six companies have a combined MCap of Rs 5,67,923 crore. The negative sentiments against the banking and financing industry, especially the fear of loan defaults and non-performing assets (NPAs), had hurt the financing businesses of Bajaj as well. But the situation is changing and Bajaj Finance's share price went back to the peaks in the last two weeks of ride. The total value of promoter holding in Bajaj group stood at Rs 3,21,486 crore, higher than Adanis.
The other major companies in the top packing order with substantial MCap are FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (Rs 5,02,147 crore) and IT firm Infosys (Rs 4,68,779 crore).
In the Tata group, the companies except TCS and Titan were facing periodic exit of investors in the recent past. However, the situation is changing with the asset optimisation strategy of chairman N Chandrasekaran and his debt reduction plans.
TCS is the most valued company under Tata fold with a MCap of Rs 10,05,320 crore as on Friday. Titan is at the second position with Rs 1,20,548 crore, followed by Tata Steel (Rs 66,215 crore), Tata Motors (Rs 55,679 crore) and Tata Consumer Products (Rs 49,672 crore). Tata Communications, Voltas, Trent and Tata Power are the other major value creators in the group.

On the other hand, Asian Paints, Titan, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Auto were among the gainers.
Domestic market swung between gains and losses in a narrow range. While most of the Asian markets recovered in green after witnessing tepid opening, Indian broader indices remained choppy throughout the day, said Binod Modi, Head- Strategy at Reliance Securities.
“However, strong buying remained visible in midcap and small-cap stocks as investors find midcaps more attractive now due to wider valuations gap compared to large caps,” he added.
As current valuations look to be reasonably stretched and the street is factoring a robust earnings growth, the sustainability of rebound in key economic indicators will be crucial for the market in the near term, he said.
 Market Upate at 11.20 am
After opening lower today, the key indices steadily fell further on lack of large buying support amid moderate selling in late morning trading session.

“Continued buying in BFSIs has been driving markets with robust FPIs flow for November so far. Going ahead, considering better prospects of earnings rebound in banks and favourable valuations, further buying in banking and financials cannot be ruled out,” he noted.

The street expects single-digit growth in FY21 earnings due to the recovery in the September quarter and improved performance in the second half of the financial year. Earnings upgrades have been seen across brokerages, with analysts pegging FY22 earnings growth at around 30 percent.
""The September quarter (Q2FY21) corporate earnings season was a blockbuster one, with big beats and upgrades across our coverage universe. With an upgrade (>5 percent) to downgrade ratio (<-5 percent) of 4:1, this has, by far, been the best earnings season in many years. 63 percent of the companies in MOFSL coverage universe beat Q2FY21 estimates, while 18 percent reported below-estimated results. This has resulted in the first material earnings upgrade for Nifty EPS estimates in many years,"" Motilal Oswal said in a report.
Corporate commentaries across sectors suggested continued demand recovery in Q3FY21, underpinned by a healthy start to the festival season, the report said.
Key reasons for strong September quarter earnings were demand recovery after COVID-19 crisis, cost control measures and lower than expected provisioning cost for the bank and financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment.

""Q2FY21 adjusted net profits of Nifty50 increased 16.4 percent YoY versus our expectation of (-) 1.6 percent. Results have been better-than-expected reflecting stronger-than-expected volumes across sectors and lower-than-expected costs. We expect net profit of Nifty50 to grow by 9.6 percent in FY21 and 29 percent in FY22 versus pre-Q2 earnings season estimates of 2.5 percent for FY21 and 33.6 percent for FY22,"" Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President (Head of Fundamental Research-PCG) at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol.
Amnish Aggarwal of Prabhudas Lilladher also said the brokerage had estimated Nifty EPS growth of 5 percent for FY21, 33.4 percent for FY22 and 17.5 percent for FY23. ""Our estimates are higher than consensus by 11 percent, 8.2 percent and 3 percent for FY21, FY22 and FY23, respectively,"" Aggarwal said.

Brokerages selected 16 largecaps as their top picks after the earnings season. These are Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Larsen & Toubro, UltraTech Cement, Britannia Industries, Dr Reddy's Labs, Hindustan Unilever, Bharti Airtel, State Bank of India, Titan Company, Divis Labs, Hero MotoCorp and Muthoot Finance.

""The best thing to happen with India incorporation is that earnings are coming without any strong volume growth. Over the last three years, earnings had disappointed due to poor GDP and revenue growth. This has led to underutilisation of capacities and no fresh Capex. A major part of free cash flows has gone in debt repayment and deleveraging. There has been a remarkable improvement in the debt-equity ratios of most companies and with lower bond yields the weighted average cost of capital has also gone down,"" Oza said.
""After getting a proper vaccine if global trade picks up, then we could see a structural growth phase led by healthy revenue growth. This can set the stage for a double-digit earnings growth in the coming few years as compared to low single-digit earnings growth seen in the past five years,"" he added.
The September quarter earnings along with improving economic data points, th egovernment's ""Atmanirbhar "" push to make India a major exporter and positive vaccine news brought the confidence at the desk of FIIs.

“Continued buying in BFSIs has been driving markets with robust FPIs flow for November so far. Going ahead, considering better prospects of earnings rebound in banks and favourable valuations, further buying in banking and financials cannot be ruled out,” he noted.
US markets were closed on Thursday due to Thanksgiving holiday. However, European stocks witnessed pressure as rising COVID-19 cases across Europe and extension of partial lockdown in Germany until December dented investor sentiment.
Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading with losses in mid-session deals, while Tokyo was in the positive territory.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, was trading 0.02% higher at USD 47.80 per barrel."

NSE warned Future Retail of action over disclosures on Amazon dispute,Moneycontrol,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nse-warned-future-retail-of-action-over-disclosures-on-amazon-dispute-6154961.html,"FIRST PUBLISHED: NOV 25, 2020 12:21 PM","India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) privately warned Future Retail it risked regulatory action for not making timely market disclosures about efforts by Amazon.com to block a disputed asset sale, according to e-mails reviewed by Reuters.
Future Retail - one of country's top retailers - has been locked in a bitter dispute with Amazon over its $3.4 billion retail assets deal with Reliance Industries. Amazon is a business partner of Future and argues the Indian firm's asset sale breached some of their pre-existing agreements.
Amazon had complained to stock exchanges, accusing Future of misleading public by making incorrect market disclosures, allegations the Indian group denies.
The complaint came after Amazon on Oct. 25 won an injunction from an arbitrator to halt the Future-Reliance deal.

Previously unreported e-mails exchanged between the NSE and Future show the stock exchange repeatedly requested the company submit more details of the arbitration order, seeking details of possible impact on financials, lenders and the Reliance deal.

On Oct. 27, NSE asked Future why it had not disclosed the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and not shared the impact of the order. Future in response said it believed a disclosure wasn't required.
NSE's listing compliance division rejected that argument. It demanded a series of disclosures be made within hours, ""failing which appropriate actions may be initiated"", the emails showed.
Future Retail's Company Secretary, Virendra Samani, answered most of NSE's queries in a late night e-mail on Oct. 30, saying it was doing so ""in the best interest of all stakeholders"", the communications showed.
Many of those responses were made public on directions of the NSE two days later in a six-page exchange filing by Future.
Before that, Future had only submitted a disclosure on Oct. 26 in which it attached a media release saying it would ensure its deal with Reliance proceeded unhindered and that it was reviewing the arbitration order.
The NSE and Future Retail did not respond to requests for comment.
The legal dispute has now reached the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail has urged the court to stop Amazon from writing letters to regulators to block its Reliance deal, which is pending approvals from the market regulator and stock exchanges. The judge is expected to rule on the plea in the coming days.
Amazon had separately asked India's market regulator to investigate Future for insider trading, saying it disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of the arbitration order before its exchange filing in late October.
Future has said its communications with Reliance, which is led by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, were for a ""legitimate purpose"".
NSE in e-mails at least twice asked Future Retail to provide a copy of the arbitration order to vet the disclosures, and also why it should not be disclosed as material price-sensitive information, emails between Oct. 27 and Oct. 30 showed.
Future's Samani at first declined the request, stating in an e-mail that the order was ""confidential in nature"" and sharing further information could be ""deterimental"" to the company. A copy was provided following NSE's warning."

Good time to buy RIL shares? Recent underperformance makes Reliance stock attractive,Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/good-time-to-buy-ril-shares-recent-underperformance-makes-reliance-stock-attractive/2136035/,"Updated: Nov 25, 2020 11:45 AM","Margins of key chemicals have surged in recent months, a move that is likely to benefit Reliance Industries.
Jio has been the largest revenue gainer despite lower increase in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) post the tariff hike of last year.
RIL share price has slipped over 2% in the last one month while the Nifty 50 has zoomed 11.5% in the same time period. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries Ltd’s recent underperformance follows its 165% rally between March and September. However, now trading at Rs 1,984 per share, down 20% from its 52-week high of Rs 2,369, has RIL corrected enough for investors to start accumulating it again?
Rebound in petchem margins
RELATED NEWS

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities believes that the rebound in petrochemical margins along with a possible tariff hike by the telecom industry are the key catalysts that might help RIL’s stock price. “We expect RIL to benefit from a sustained sharp recovery in Asian margins for key petchem products in recent months from the lows of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019, which will help in mitigating weakness in refining even as it recovers gradually,” Kotak Securities said in a report.
Margins of key chemicals have surged in recent months, a move that is likely to benefit RIL. Spreads for polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC over naphtha have increased sharply in recent months, reflecting a healthy pickup in demand from packaging, consumer and healthcare segments and slower additions to capacities. “We expect margins to improve to US$196/ton in FY2022 reflecting a sustained recovery in global demand and slower additions to polymer capacity amid weak economics of coal-to-olefins projects,” the report said. Refining margins are expected to recover gradually.
Tariff hike to help Jio
After having completed the stake sale in Jio Platforms to global investors such as Facebook, Google, PIF, among others, the next move that will aid the telecom and digital services division of RIL will be a tariff hike. “In our view, Jio may welcome a hike in telecom tariff by the industry, wholly or at least partly, in order to improve its own business economics as potential revenue streams from other digital initiatives may take time to shape up,” Kotak Securities added.
Jio has been the largest revenue gainer despite lower increase in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) post the tariff hike of last year. In the previous quarter, Jio’s APRU came in at Rs 145 per month while Bharti Airtel had an ARPU of Rs 162.2 per month. However, net addition of subscribers was healthier for Jio along with a larger revenue.
“The sharp 32% underperformance of RIL versus the broader markets over the past two months offers an opportunity to accumulate. A near-term improvement in outlook for O2C and telecom business may lead to a rerating of the stock, which may also act as a hedge against any weakness in the broader markets,” the brokerage firm said. With an ‘Add’ rating on RIL, Kotak Securities has a fair value of Rs 2,150 per share.

Reliance Jio’s ARPU can grow to Rs 200 in 1-2 years,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/reliance-jios-arpu-can-grow-to-rs-200-in-1-2-years/articleshow/79385652.cms,"Last Updated: Nov 24, 2020, 06:50 PM IST","Sushil Choksey, Managing Director, Indus Equity Advisors, says that Reliance Jio's current average revenue per user (ARPU) can grow from Rs 145 to Rs 200 in the next 1-2 years as many new features are getting added on to the Jio platform. Edited excerpts from an interview.

After the massive funding in both Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail over the last few months, what is the long-term trend looking like?
If you go division wise, the roadmap is very clear that Reliance will have three entities - Jio, Retail and oil-to-chemicals. We need to watch out for which entities will be listed at the earliest, and if the O2C business gets any funding infusion like Jio and Retail businesses did.

The oil-to-chemicals business has the best class of assets and refining margins in Asia. The expansion is over, but I think the next shape of technology and requirement of products is going to be looked at. As a manufacturing hub under 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', packaging is going to be a necessity and plastic would be used for everything. At the same time, different polymers would also be needed. There is a huge scope in oil-to-chemicals division. The fair value of the division should be around Rs 525,000-550,000 crore.

Jio's current ARPU of Rs 145 can head towards Rs 200 in the next fiscal year or after that. Many new features are coming on the Jio platform, so I am quite hopeful. Competition is here to stay between the three of them (Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio).

In retail, it depends on the merger with Future Group. Sales were not that positive in the first two quarters. Amid competition from e-commerce, it depends on how they integrate the kirana stores with WhatsApp and JioMart. They may become the largest supply chain guys to kirana stores in India.

Looking at all the three divisions, the stock is here to perform well. But after a stellar run like this, a correction of 10-20 per cent was likely to happen."

A top US health official said on Sunday the first coronavirus vaccines could be given to healthcare workers and others recommended by mid-December, boosting Asian stock markets on Monday.
In India, the Nifty was up 0.04% at 12,864.10 by 0510 GMT. The Sensex eased 0.05% to 43,860.60.

Amazon, which acquired an indirect minority stake in Future Retail (FRL) last year, has alleged that Future’s sale of its businesses to Reliance breached its pre-existing contract, which included a right of the first offer and a non-compete clause.
Last month, SIAC restrained FRL and its founders from going ahead with the sale until a final decision was given. Subsequently, Amazon wrote to Sebi, the stock exchanges and the CCI, urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order.
Future Retail moved the Delhi High Court earlier this month seeking necessary relief against Amazon from interfering with the transaction by misusing an interim order issued by an emergency arbitrator, appointed by SIAC.
Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for FRL, told the court that the US-based company is trying to mislead the Indian authorities by giving the impression that the Singapore arbitration award is legally binding while it is not. FRL said the e-commerce firm was misrepresenting its legal rights and behaving like “East India Company”. Amazon on its part argued that Indian law grants sanctity to international arbitration orders if the parties were willing participants.
The case is currently being heard in the Delhi High Court, which on Friday reserved its order. Justice Mukta Gupta heard arguments for five days and asked the parties to give written submissions, if any, by November 23.

""These businesses operate on a pan-India basis, and include retail operations across segments such as food and grocery, apparel, footwear and accessories, other merchandise, etc.""
Meanwhile, e-commerce major Amazon has opposed the deal between Future Group and Reliance Industries.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on November 10 approved the acquisition of retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing businesses of Future Group by Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Ltd.
""Commission approves acquisition of retail, wholesale, logistics & warehousing businesses of Future Group by Reliance Retail Ventures Limited and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited,"" CCI wrote on Twitter.
Earlier on August 29, 2020, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries had announced the acquisition of businesses of Kishore Biyani's Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore.
The mega transaction cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.

The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).
The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.
Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25. 
Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.
Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.
Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

"Sensex rises 282 points, Nifty ends above 12,850; banking stocks lead gains",Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/market-perspective/sensex-rises-282-points-nifty-ends-above-12850-banking-stocks-lead-gains/story/422549.html,"Rupa Burman Roy | November 20, 2020 | Updated 18:02 IST","After a volatile trading session, benchmark indices turned bullish in the last hour and closed positive on Friday, tracking positive cues from global markets and sustained foreign fund inflows.
Reversing the trend from yesterday's losses, Sensex ended 282 points higher at 43,882 and Nifty rose 87 points to end at 12,859. Yesterday, Sensex reversed the trend after 3 days and fell 580 points to close at 43,600, while Nifty ended 166 points to 12,771. During the week, Sensex and Nifty have gained 439 points or 1.01% and 139 points or 1.09%, respectively.
Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank, Bharti Airtel, Nestle India and NTPC were among the top gainers today. On the other hand, Reliance Industries, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, ONGC, and HUL were among the laggards. Among sectors, barring media and pharma, all sectors closed in green territory, with banking, financials, IT, and FMCG closing above 1% each.
Today, Dow Futures and Nasdaq Futures were down by 0.3% and 0.1% respectively, while London's FTSE was up by 0.6%.
US equities ended with modest gains on Thursday following a report that US lawmakers may restart negotiations on economic stimulus, overshadowing concerns of rising COVID-19 cases and increasing restrictions. Further, preliminary data released earlier on Thursday stated University of Oxford and AstraZeneca's vaccine candidate triggered a similar immune response among all adults. Oxford and AstraZeneca's data came a day after Pfizer and BioNTech said their Covid-19 vaccine candidate was 95% effective.
Asian markets were mixed on the last trading day of the week as investors continued to weigh in rising coronavirus cases and likely increase in restrictions. Traders said the recent rise in markets on the back of vaccine development saw some profit booking amid fresh fears of the shutdown.
Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities said,"" Nifty 50 index closed the week with a mild gain after making an all-time high of 12963. But now the benchmark index has formed a bullish reversal pattern which opened with a gap near highs of the week and then gave up all the gains. The rally's velocity has also been declining along with the volume participation. In fact, Nifty has started facing resistance at the rising channel visible on the weekly chart and might continue to struggle going ahead as it lacks participation from the top index movers like ICICI Bank, HDFC, and banking stocks, who have also become a bit stretched on the upside in the short term. We suggest traders to keep an eye on the benchmark and go short unless it breaks the rising channel on the upside.""
Jyoti Roy- DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking said,"" While markets are not cheap at current levels they are also not very expensive and therefore we believe that a 10-12% upside is very much possible in the markets over the next one year. The increasing likelihood of a second US stimulus package coupled with low-interest rates globally should result in continued strong FPI flows to India. Positive news flow on the vaccine front 2021 has also contributed to the risk-on rally over the past few weeks. While markets are not cheap at current levels and there could be some short-term volatility over the next few months in case of any adverse news flows, we remain positive on the markets from a longer-term perspective. Abundant global liquidity, strong revival in earnings in FY22 coupled with prospects of a medical solution to the Covid-19 crisis should drive markets over the next year despite any short term volatility.""
On the currency front, the Indian rupee appreciated by 11 paise to settle at 74.16 per US dollar on Friday.
Expressing views on the currency, Sugandha Sachdeva VP-Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Broking said,"" The rupee is currently drawing a lot of support from equity inflows and the fact that the dollar globally is on the backfoot. Going forward, we think that the rupee has scope to further appreciate till 73.80. However, beyond that, the RBI would step in to curtail its move, while the dollar index may also rebound given the uncertain growth outlook in the U.S. That should put some downward pressure on the rupee. The domestic unit is expected to trade in the 73.80 to 75 band till the end of this month.""

The global funds are enticed by the potential for RRVL to corner a chunk of India’s $800 billion annual retail market that is expected to swell to $1.3 trillion in the next three to four years. Reliance Retail operates 12,000 brick-and-mortar stores and has in May launched its e-commerce venture JioMart that seeks to marry the vast Reliance Retail network of outlets on its technological platform and plans to enrol legions of kirana outlets as last mile delivery and selling agents.

“Reliance Industries Limited (“Reliance Industries”) and Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (“RRVL”) have completed the current phase of partner induction and fund raise exercise for RRVL,” the press release said.

ET had reported in September that RIL is planning to raise about Rs 60,000-63,000 crore by selling a 15% stake in Reliance Retail and the Mumbai conglomerate has offered stakes to all the firms that had earlier this year injected capital into Jio Platforms when the RIL-owned telecom services provider attracted $20 billion FDI by selling 33% stake in the company to ten global funds and four US tech giants of Google, Facebook, Intel and Qualcomm."

BT Buzz: Can BPCL acquisition slingshot Anil Agarwal to Mukesh Ambani’s league?,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/bt-buzz/news/bt-buzz-can-bpcl-acquisition-slingshot-anil-agarwal-to-mukesh-ambani-league/story/422409.html,"Nevin John | November 19, 2020 | Updated 13:45 IST","Click here to Enlarge
Metal baron Anil Agarwal has upped the ante in oil sector with submission of expression of interest (EoI) for BPCL. Agarwal's move comes while Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani soft pedals the game in fossil fuel. Agarwal has a high chance of winning the race for BPCL since the government has received just three EoIs, including two from foreign funds. BPCL will be a strategic fit for Agarwal's Vedanta Ltd as it already produces fuels from onshore hydrocarbon assets under subsidiary Cairn.
Agarwal is looking to enter the refining business while Ambani diversifies into consumer-focused sectors through Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail. In the last annual general meeting, Ambani said Reliance Industries (RIL) targets to become a net carbon-zero company by 2035. He wants to build RIL as a new energy and new materials company.
RIL wants to convert 70 per cent of its output from Jamnagar refinery and petrochemical complex to high-margin chemicals. At present, the complex produces 90 per cent fuels - primarily petrol, diesel, naphtha, kerosene and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) - and the rest 10 per cent chemicals.
Rumour mills are also silent on Ambani's plan to build a third refinery or adding capacities to existing ones. There aren't too many competitors in the sector. The Ruias of Essar were once aggressive in refining business, but they eventually sold their refinery in Vadinar, Gujarat to Russian giant Rosneft in 2017. Agarwal, who has made a fortune buying and fixing state-run companies, clearly senses an opportunity even though global oil giants have stayed away from bidding for BPCL.
Agarwal entered oil sector with acquisition of Cairn India in 2012. But he turned aggressive last year with bids for hydrocarbon exploration and production (E&P) assets under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP). Cairn was the only serious private bidder, which bagged 51 blocks out of the 87 that were auctioned in the first three rounds of OALP.
However, Ambani's RIL, which generated over 60 per cent of its profit from oil refining until two years ago, shied away from OALP bids. Besides, it continued surrendering unproductive blocks back to the government. Last year, RIL transferred entire stake in Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields to ONGC after operating the fields in a joint venture for 25 years. But it has invested Rs 40,000 crore jointly with BP Plc to revamp production at KG basin.
BP also invested a billion dollars in oil marketing business of RIL. The refining business of RIL is facing the crude price volatility and demand slump. It has affected the gross refining margin (GRM) of RIL. Ambani wanted to sell 20 per cent stake in RIL's oil to chemicals business to Saudi Aramco for Rs 1.1 lakh crore. But the deal is yet to fructify.
While the timing seems perfect for Agarwal, analysts are concerned about the debt of the parent company Vedanta Resources. Moody's Investors Service said last month that it had placed Vedanta Resources's B1 corporate family rating (CFR) under review for downgrade. The gross debt of India-listed Vedanta Ltd was at Rs 62,759 crore in September.
JP Morgan Equity Research says the 75 per cent acquisition of BPCL will cost Vedanta between Rs 64,200 crore and Rs 97,600 crore. The research agency doubts the ability of Vedanta to raise funds at such a massive scale. However, it estimates that the dividend yield from the oil refiner may be enough to cover the interest payment obligations.
""While Vedanta Ltd on a consolidated basis is not very leveraged, the key question has been the leverage at the unlisted parent and the inter-company loans to the parent (currently at around $1 billion). In this context, we struggle to see how Vedanta Ltd secures funding,"" JP Morgan report said.
Agarwal has the track record of successfully creating value out of state-owned assets; Hindustan Zinc and Balco are proof. He can reduce the financial risk of BPCL acquisition by bringing in financial partners.
Agarwal is also preparing to raise an investment fund targeting turnaround opportunities. He is working with Centricus Asset Management Ltd. and has started approaching potential investors for the proposed India Direct Investment Fund, which will buy stakes in government companies sold under the disinvestment programme.
However, an EoI does not automatically translate into an actual bid and Vedanta could very well drop off in the financial round of BPCL bidding.  But if it manages to acquire BPCL, it will transform Vedanta group.
But, even with BPCL Agarwal will still not have the scale of Mukesh Ambani and RIL. Agarwal's Vedanta currently has a market capitalisation of Rs 42,400 crore. BPCL is valued Rs 84,800 crore in the stock market. In comparison, Ambani's RIL has a market cap of Rs 13 lakh crore.
Cairn produces about a fifth of all the oil consumed in the country and BPCL takeover will give a boost to the group's energy thrust through its four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi and Bina, although the Numaligarh facility in Assam will be hived off. BPCL accounts for 15 per cent of the India's refining capacity of close to 250 million tonne.
It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps, 6,011 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) distributorships and 51 LPG bottling plants. The government wants to close BPCL transaction by March as it is hoping to mop up close to Rs 45,000 crore from the sale, which will be the major component of its disinvestment target of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for the current financial year.
On November 6 Vedanta reported 61.8 percent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 824 crore for the quarter ended September on the back of one time tax expense.
Income during July-September declined to Rs 21,744 crore from Rs 22,814 crore in the year-ago period. The rise in revenue was primarily due to higher commodity prices, higher volumes at Zinc India, iron ore, copper and power business, partially offset by lower volumes at aluminium and steel business and rupee appreciation.

Vedanta says it’s in the fray for BPCL,Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/vedanta-says-its-in-the-fray-for-bpcl/2131407/,"November 19, 2020 7:30 AM","Many, including Reliance Industries, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil and France’s Total, were earlier reported as eyeing the controlling stake in BPCL, India’s second largest oil marketing company with a market share of 21%.
Vedanta Ltd had acquired a 58.5% stake in Cairn India for $8.67 billion in 2011.
Vedanta Ltd, India arm of Anil Agarwal-controlled, London-headquartered Vedanta group on Wednesday said it formally evinced interest in state-run oil refiner and marketer BPCL, which is on the block. While the government had confirmed receipt of “multiple expressions of interests” from domestic and foreign firms for the controlling stake in the oil major by the Monday evening deadline, Vedanta is the first potential bidder to confirm it’s in the fray.
The BPCL stock closed at Rs 383.2 on the BSE on Wednesday, falls 2.85% from previous day’s closing. Vedanta rose 1.4% to close at Rs 108.9.

BPCL owns and operates four refineries in India and 15% share of the country’s 250 million tonne refining capacity; it also has a 17,000-strong retail fuel outlet network in the country, and a over quarter of the retail market share. Its privatisation is seen as critical for the government to boost its non-debt capital receipts this fiscal, when all revenue streams are faltering due to deep economic slump caused by Covid.
“Vedanta’s expression of interest (EoI) for BPCL is to evaluate potential synergies with our existing oil and gas business. The EoI is at a preliminary stage and exploratory in nature,” a company spokesperson said.
News agencies reported that two other foreign-funded firms have also submitted EoIs for buying the government’s stake in BPCL, but FE could not independently verify this. Many, including Reliance Industries, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil and France’s Total, were earlier reported as eyeing the controlling stake in BPCL, India’s second largest oil marketing company with a market share of 21%.
Vedanta Ltd had acquired a 58.5% stake in Cairn India for $8.67 billion in 2011. Vedanta Group had acquired a majority stake in Bharat Aluminium Company (Balco), then a PSU, in 2001; it has also over the years acquired a controlling stake in Hindustan Zinc, starting with a 26% stake it bought in 2002-03. A Supreme Court decision is being awaited on the sale of the government’s residual stakes in these companies.
Private firms have a share of over a quarter of the country’s crude oil output, more than 90% it comes from Vedanta-owned Cairn assets in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. The remaining 74% domestic crude is produced by state-run ONGC and Oil India. To be sure, about 85% of the India’s crude oil needs are still met by imports.
While refusing to comment on the prospect of individual companies in BPCL sale process, K Ravichandran, senior vice-president at Icra, told FE that “the buyer will have to rationalise costs to generate value and optimize synergy”.
“The current global sentiment on fossil fuel poses a challenge, possibly deterring large global oil companies from placing bids, but for a developing country like India, there is no uncertainty for at least another decade,” Ravichandran added.
BPCL operates four refineries in India, Mumbai Refinery, Kochi Refinery, BORL-Bina Refinery (Bharat Oman Refineries Limited, a joint venture between BPCL and Oman Oil Company) and Numaligarh Refinery with a combined crude oil refining capacity of 38.3 million tonne per annum. BPCL’s stake in Numaligarh refinery will be sold to another CPSE oil firm separately.
Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings, said: “BPCL is a well-established company where the new owner does not have to create new infrastructure, and if a private Indian oil company buys it, then it is a case of potential synergies”.
Seven-and-a-half months into the fiscal, the Centre is now making a determined effort to sell its stake in BPCL, which was worth Rs 44,040 crore at Wednesday’s closing price on the BSE. The government’s stake in BPCL was worth about Rs 60,000 crore in November 2019, around the time the stake sale proposal was approved by the Union Cabinet.
However, the actual receipts will depend on valuation and consideration of a premium (ONGC had bought the Centre’s stake in HPCL in FY18 at a premium of 14% to the stock’s price). As per Sebi takeover code rules, an acquirer company has obligation to launch a mandatory open offer for an additional 26% stake in the target company.
The stake sale, expected to be completed this fiscal was earlier seen to fetch around Rs 70,000 crore to the exchequer. The BPCL sale is likely to be single largest component of the Centre’s disinvestment receipts this fiscal, which is likely to be far below the ambitious `2.1 lakh crore budgeted.

HOMEINDUSTRYVedanta Says Its In The Fray For BPCL"
Vedanta Group submits EOI to buy government’s entire stake in BPCL,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/vedanta-group-submits-eoi-to-buy-government-s-entire-stake-in-bpcl-120111801035_1.html,"Last Updated at November 18, 2020 22:17 IST","Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group said on Wednesday that it has submitted an expression of interest (EoI) for buying 52.98 per cent government stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL).
“Vedanta’s EoI for BPCL is to evaluate potential synergies with our existing oil and gas business. The EoI is at a preliminary stage and is exploratory in nature,” said a company spokesperson.
At least three to four players have reportedly submitted EoIs for the privatisation process of BPCL. The deadline for submission was Monday, but the government has not officially revealed any names.
Vedanta has been venturing into new business segments ever since it bought Cairn India in December 2011. It also branched out into gold mining. It also acquired the control of Electrosteel Steels under a resolution plan, thereby foraying into the steel sector in 2018. However, industry experts indicate that with the recent failure of the delisting process and the company sitting on a debt-pile of reportedly over Rs 1.25 trillion, the acquisition of BPCL may not be easy for the metals-to-mining conglomerate.
According to rating agency S&P Global, the failed delisting has narrowed the refinancing options for its parent company Vedanta Resources, raising risks over the company’s ability to sustainably service its debt beyond the next 12 months. Vedanta’s scrip was up 1.4 per cent on Wednesday at Rs 108.85. The bidding for BPCL includes two stages: one, participation of qualified bidders in the EoI stage; and two, financial bids. Any private company with a net worth of over $10 billion will be eligible for bidding, or a consortium of not more than four firms will be allowed to participate.
Though Adani Group is another big corporate name that is believed to have evinced an interest in BPCL, a group company Adani Gas has clarified on the BSE that there are no pending information or announcements to be made. When asked a specific query on whether the group has placed an EoI, an Adani Group spokesperson refrained from commenting.
Adani has a tie-up with French major Total for retailing both natural gas as well as liquid automobile fuel. A Total spokesperson for India, however, said the local branch was not aware of any EoI being submitted for BPCL.
The sale of BPCL is crucial to meet the divestment target of Rs 2.1 trillion for the current financial year. According to reports, other than Vedanta, some private equity funds and/or pension funds have also placed EoIs.
A day after the EoI deadline, the BPCL stock closed at Rs 394.45 on Tuesday. The news of Vedanta placing an EoI, however, did not enthuse investors, with the stock price falling 2.85 per cent on Wednesday to Rs 383.2.
According to multiple sources, major players like Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, and ExxonMobil had shied away from the bidding process.
It was in November last year that the Union Cabinet had cleared the sale of the government’s entire stake in BPCL. Following this, EoIs were invited from investors on March 7.
Based on the current market capitalisation of Rs 83,125.8 crore, the value of government share’s in BPCL comes to around Rs 44,040 crore. For investors, around 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity, 16,492 retail outlets, and 72 million LPG customers will be on offer.
The government’s plan is to sell its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising 1.15 billion equity shares, with the transfer of management control to a strategic buyer, excluding the company’s 61.65 per cent in the Numaligarh Refinery in Assam.
BPCL operates four refineries in India — Mumbai Refinery, Kochi Refinery, BORL-Bina Refinery (Bharat Oman Refineries) and Numaligarh Refinery (1999) with a combined crude oil refining capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum. The company runs 24 per cent or 17,138 of the total 71,843 retail outlets in India. The company also has a share of 26 per cent of the total 285 million liquefied petroleum gas consumers in India."

Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) share price opened lower by over a percent after major energy companies skip race for stake sale.
The government had extended the deadline for bids for BPCL, one of India's most profitable state-owned companies, as the pandemic delayed the process that was initially expected to be completed by October.
The stock was trading at Rs 388.85, down Rs 5.60, or 1.42 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 395.00 and an intraday low of Rs 387.80.
Market sentiments were dampened as energy giants including Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco and BP gave the bidding process a miss and did not submit Expressions of Interest for the 52.98 percent of the stake on sale.
The government on November 16 said that multiple EoIs have been received for divestment of Centre's stake in the company.

RIL’s fund-raising includes ₹1,52,055 crore equity from 13 investors, including Facebook and Google, for a 33 per cent stake in Jio Platforms; ₹53,124 crore from a rights issue in May, and ₹47,215-crore equity raised from nine investors for a 10.52 per cent stake in Reliance Retail Ventures. Also in July, BP plc acquired a 49 per cent stake in RIL’s fuel retailing business for $1billion (₹7,629 crore).
On the face of it, RIL did indeed raise funds in excess of its stated net debt, supporting its claim of net debt-free status. But is the company really net debt-free?
In an apparent rush to declare itself net debt free, RIL changed its estimate of net debt as of March 31, 2019, in its 2019 and 2020 annual reports and adopted a rather liberal definition of net debt.
RIL’s net debt as of March 31, 2019, according to its FY2019 annual report, was ₹1,54,478 crore. In the FY2020 annual report, the net debt as of March 31, 2019 was miraculously lower by ₹3,716 crore at ₹1,50,762 crore, despite there being no restatement of its FY2019 accounts! (See graphic)
 RIL’s reported gross debt figure in both annual reports, as of March 31, 2019, is ₹2,87,505 crore. However, its estimate of cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2019 in its FY2020 annual report increased to ₹1,36,743 crore from ₹1,33,027 crore in the FY2019 annual report.
This leads us to RIL’s interesting definition of marketable securities and, hence, net debt.
Bankers and analysts define net debt, that is, the effective amount of money an entity owes, as its consolidated debt minus assets that are most liquid, of stable nominal value and transparent such as cash and bank deposits. Cash is legal tender and deposits are held in banks that are regulated entities.
RIL has defined net debt as consolidated debt minus cash and marketable securities. Here, again, the company has taken liberties with the definition of marketable securities. Marketable securities are listed financial assets, including shares, bonds, debentures, preference shares, money market instruments, mutual fund units and exchange traded funds (ETFs). Liquidity is the distinguishing characteristic of marketable securities.
Deducting ‘marketable securities’, especially unlisted investments in group companies, from consolidated debt contravenes the concept of net debt because these assets do not meet the criteria of liquid and transparent assets of stable nominal value. These unlisted securities are intra-group investments.
Marketable securities
RIL’s definition of marketable securities includes its investments in two unlisted associates, Jio Digital Fibre Private Limited and Reliance Jio Infratel Private Limited, which operate Reliance Jio’s fibre and tower assets.
According to RIL’s FY20 annual report, cash and marketable securities include cash and cash equivalents of ₹30,920 crore (previous year ₹11,081 crore), current investments of ₹72,915 crore (previous year ₹71,023 crore) and other marketable securities of ₹71,424 crore (previous year ₹54,639 crore) including investments in Jio Digital Fibre Private Limited and Reliance Jio Infratel Private Limited.
Of RIL’s ₹72,915-crore current investments, those worth ₹40,993 crore are unlisted. RIL has invested ₹1,18,296 crore as equity, preference shares and non-convertible debentures in the unlisted Jio Digital Fibre and Reliance Jio . It is unclear which of these ₹1,18,296 crore investments is included in RIL’s ₹71,424 crore of “other marketable securities.” The quantum of listed securities in RIL’s “other marketable securities” portfolio is also unclear.
‘Other marketable securities’
Assuming that the entire “other marketable securities” portfolio is unlisted, ₹1,12,417 crore (₹40,993 crore plus ₹71,424 crore) or 78 per cent of RIL’s marketable securities is unlisted, or not-so-marketable after all.
RIL further states in its FY20 annual report that “if investment in RIL shares held by Petroleum Trust and Reliance Services and Holdings Limited is considered as marketable securities, the net debt shall further reduce by ₹43,294 crore to ₹1,17,741 crore.” But share prices, even those of a company as large and profitable as RIL, do not exhibit stable nominal values; share prices fluctuate. RIL shares owned by related entities are simply not the same as cash and bank deposits.
As of March 31 2020, RIL’s consolidated debt was ₹3,36,294 crore. So, after deducting ₹30,920 crore cash-on-hand and the ₹2,60,024 crore cash inflow from the recent fund raising, net debt is ₹45,350 crore. Though reported financial leverage is low after the mammoth fund-raising, RIL is not net debt free; not yet. This estimate assumes that RIL received all investment commitments from its stake sales and rights issue upfront and excludes ₹18,839 crore spectrum liabilities payable to the Department of Telecom, Jio Digital Fibre’s and Reliance Jio Infratel’s outstanding debt, ₹8,697 crore lease liabilities, and ₹106,525 crore of “other financial liabilities”.
Investors in RIL’s May 2020 rights issue are required to pay only 25 per cent of their investment upfront. The balance is payable in two instalments in May and November 2021.
Factoring in the deferred proceeds from the rights issue and the other liabilities listed above, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, based on annualised first half performance in FY2021, is a not insignificant at 2.44 times."

Tata Steel (NS: TISC ) was trading at Rs. 527.2, up over 7% thanks to its better than expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenues came in at Rs. 37,154 crore compared to Rs. 34,579 crore for the same period in 2019.

Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is handling the strategic sale, tweeted that the transaction advisors for the sale of government's 52.98 per cent stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have reported receiving ""multiple expressions of interest.""
""The transaction will move to the second stage after scrutiny by TA,"" he said.
TA stands for transaction advisor.
""Strategic disinvestment of BPCL progresses: Now moves to the second stage after multiple expressions of interest have been received,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also tweeted.
Neither of them however gave the number of bids received or the names of the bidders.
Separately, four industry officials said 3-4 bids have been put in.
Reliance Industries, which was considered a potential bidder as BPCL would have added 22 per cent fuel market share to its fledgling retail business and made it the nation's number one oil refiner, did not put in an expression of interest (EoI) at the close of the deadline on Monday.
Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco), which had been keen to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel market, too did not put in an EoI.
UK's BP plc and Total of France - who have plans to foray into the Indian fuel market - had previously ruled themselves out of the BPCL race as they did not want to add oil refining assets when the world was moving away from liquid fuels.
A clutch of private equity funds and/or pension funds are said to have put in an EoI.
Russian energy giant Rosneft-led Nayara Energy, which operates a 20 million tonne oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat and also has 5,822 petrol pumps, was considered a potential bidder for BPCL but reports last month had indicated it was no longer keen.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), which has ambitions for Indian market, too was considered a potential bidder but it wasn't immediately known if it had put in an EoI.
Mining billionaire Anil Agarwal is considered another potential bidder given his interest in the oil and gas business with the USD 8.67 billion acquisition of Cairn India.
Sources said transaction advisors will now evaluate the bidders to ascertain if they indeed meet the qualifying criteria and would have the financial muscle to do the acquisition.
This process may take 2-3 weeks, thereafter request for proposal (RFP) will be issued and financial bids sought.
At Friday's closing price of ?412.70 on BSE, the government's 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL is worth ?47,430 crore. Also, the acquirer would have to make an open offer for buying another 26 per cent stake from the public, which would cost ?23,276 crore.
BPCL will give the buyer ownership to 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share.
Privatisation of BPCL is essential for meeting the record ?2.1 lakh crore target the finance minister has set from disinvestment proceeds in the budget for 2020-21.
BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh), and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonne per annum, which is 15.3 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.8 million tonne.
While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonne of refining capacity - 12 million tonne Mumbai unit, 15.5 million tonne Kochi refinery and 7.8 million tonne Bina unit.
It also owns 17,138 petrol pumps, 6,151 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 256 aviation fuel stations in the country.
BPCL is India's second-largest oil marketing company with a standalone domestic sales volume of over 43.10 million tonnes and a market share of 22 per cent during FY20. It is India's 6th largest company by turnover.
Its petrol pumps sell more fuel than the industry average - BPCL pumps sell 124 kilolitres per month as compared to the industry average of 116, according to the company website.
The firm also has upstream presence with 26 assets in 9 countries such as Russia, Brazil, Mozambique, the UAE, Indonesia, Australia, East Timor, Israel and India. It is also making a foray into city gas distribution and has licences for 37 geographical areas (GAs).

The asking price of close to $10 billion by the government for selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake may keep the energy giants away from bidding for a majority stake in the second largest oil refinery and marketing company in India. This comes at a time when the world is moving away from conventional fuel.
The government has extended the date of putting in the preliminary expression of interest (EoI) on four occasions, with the current deadline now being shifted to November 16. As per Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey, the deadline won't be extended anymore.
Billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), that operates the world's largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, intends to expand into the retail business and has strong ambitions to sell fuel. However, the oil conglomerate has so far remained tight-lipped on its intentions regarding BPCL.
A few days back, RIL also hired former BPCL chairman Sarthak Behuria and former IOCL chairman Sanjeev Singh. Reports say the two could be connected to RIL's plan to bid for BPCL. However, there's no official confirmation from the company so far.
If at all that happens, Reliance will be able to combine its Jamnagar refinery with BPCL' Mumbai, Kochi and Bina units and merge more than 1406 of its fuel stations with BPCL's 17,138 petrol pumps.
The stake sale will give buyer access to 15.3% of India's oil refining capacity from BPCL's three refineries - Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala and Bina in Madhya Pradesh, and a nationwide readymade fuel retailing network that controls 22% market share in the world's fastest-growing energy market.
The government is keen on closing the stake sale before March 31, 2021, for meeting the record Rs 2.1 lakh crore divestment target set by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for FY21.

RIL’s retail arm RRVL picks up 96% stake in Urban Ladder for over Rs 182 cr,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/ril-s-retail-arm-rrvl-picks-up-96-stake-in-urban-ladder-for-over-rs-182-cr-120111500353_1.html,"Last Updated at November 15, 2020 15:03 IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries' retail arm has picked up 96 per cent stake in online furniture retailer Urban Ladder for over Rs 182 crore.
Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), a subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL) , has acquired equity shares of Urban Ladder Home Decor Solutions Pvt Ltd for a cash consideration of Rs 182.12 crore, RIL said in a statement on Saturday.
The investment represents 96 per cent holding in the equity share capital of Urban Ladder, it added.
RRVL has a further option of acquiring the balance stake, taking its shareholding to 100 per cent of the equity share capital of Urban Ladder, it said.
Besides, RRVL has proposed to make a further investment of up to Rs 75 crore in Urban Ladder.
The further investment is expected to be completed by December 2023, it said.
This acquisition will help RIL in bolstering its presence in the fast-growing e-commerce segment and widening the bouquet of consumer products provided by it as it looks to compete with e-commerce majors as Amazon and Flipkart.
The aforesaid investment will further enable the group's digital and new commerce initiatives and widen the bouquet of consumer products provided by the group, while enhancing user engagement and experience across its retail offerings, the statement said.
According to RIL, no governmental or regulatory approvals were required for the investment.
In August, RIL had acquired a majority stake in digital pharma marketplace Netmeds for around Rs 620 crore.
RIL, which has been on a fund raising spree by selling stakes in RRVL, had earlier this month announced Rs 9,555 crore investment from Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, taking total fundraise in the last two months to Rs 47,265 crore.
The investment had valued RRVL at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.587 lakh crore.
Reliance Retail Ltd, a subsidiary of RRVL, operates India's largest, fast-growing retail business witnessing close to 640 million footfalls at its 12,000 stores across the country.
Amazon, Reliance and Walmart Inc's Flipkart are locked in a battle to gain market share in India, where millions of middle-class customers are adopting online purchase of food and groceries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The booming e-commerce market in the country will be worth USD 86 billion by 2024, according to research firm Forrester.
The stakes are particularly high for Amazon, which believes India is a big growth market after shutting its online store in China last year.
Reliance Retail's vision is to galvanise the Indian retail sector through its new commerce strategy, serving millions of customers by empowering micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), RIL had said earlier.
RRVL had previously raised Rs 37,710 crore from leading global investors including Silver Lake, KKR, General Atlantic, Mubadala, GIC, TPG and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).
Urban Ladder was co-founded by Ashish Goel (CEO) and Rajiv Srivatsa (COO) in July 2012.
In 2014, Tata Sons chairman emeritusRatan Tatahad also invested in Urban Ladder, though the amount was not disclosed. In the past, the company had also raised funds from venture capital funds such as Sequoia Capital, SAIF Partners, Kalaari Capital and hedge fund Steadview Capital.
Besides online, the company has presence in offline channels and operates a chain of retail stores in several cities across India as Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, NCR, Pune and Hyderabad.
Urban Ladder's audited turnover in 2018-19 was Rs 434.00 crore and profit was Rs 49.41 crore."

 The eight-year-old furniture start-up, which has been struggling to raise funds for over two years, axed 40 per cent of its staff in the March 2019 quarter in a bid to stay afloat as it continued to work at cutting costs to achieve profitability. While this may have bought it some time, the outbreak of Covid-19 came as a nail  in its business. Last October, co-founder Rajiv Srivatsa exited the company.
Urban Ladder had shifted from an inventory-led online business model to omnichannel retail after it received the single brand retail licence from the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion in August 2017. It set up a chain of 10 retail stores in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai, Noida, Hyderabad and Pune, some of which were shut down during the lockdown.
“With 90 per cent of the furniture industry still unorganised in India and leading business house like Reliance showing strong interest in this domain,  there is high potential in this space and there is a big gap that needs to be filled in a more organised way,” said Lokendra Ranawat, co-founder and CEO, WoodenStreet, a Jaipur-based recent entrant into the online furniture space.
“It also gives a strong message to the start-up community and entrepreneurs about the importance of building more fundamental and true sustainable business models” he added.

Reliance Retail acquires home-products online retailer Urban Ladder,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/reliance-retail-acquires-home-products-online-retailer-urban-ladder/articleshow/79229914.cms,"Last Updated: Nov 15, 2020, 11:47 PM IST","Reliance Retail Ventures’ near total acquisition of online furniture retailer Urban Ladder has delivered only a partial return to top tier investment firms that had backed the Bengaluru-based startup, said two investors privy to the details of the transaction, which they termed as a “distress” sale.

On Saturday, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) told stock exchanges that its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. (RRVL) had acquired a 96% share in Urban Ladder through an all-cash transaction for Rs 182 crore ($ 24 million). The deal, which closed after protracted negotiations over several months, provides RRVL with the option to further enhance its stake to 100%. The oil-to- telecom conglomerate said it would invest an additional Rs 75 crore in Urban Ladder by December 2023.

“ On an average, top tier investment firms including Sequoia Capital, Elevation Capital (formerly SAIF Partners), Steadview Capital and Kalaari Capital have been able to recover only a fifth of their invested capital in Urban Ladder, following its sale to Reliance Retail,” said the people cited above.

Founded in2012 by Ashish Goel and Rajiv Srivatsa, the furniture portal had raised a total of about Rs 860 crore ($115 million) in venture funding and was last valued at over Rs 1,200 crore ($160 million).

“The sale is at about 20 cents to a dollar raised,"" said one investor on the condition of anonymity. The RRVL acquisition valued at about $24 million is a “ distress” sale, investors told ET.

“The founding team, including CEO Goel, is likely to stay back for a year to help with the transition,"" said another person aware of the details.

Email queries sent to Sequoia, Elevation Capital, Kalaari Capital and Steadview did not elicit a response until press time. Urban Ladder did not offer comment.

The deal underscores the rising appetite for buyouts of Indian startups by the Mukesh Ambani -led conglomerate that acquired e-pharmacy venture NetMeds in August.

For Urban Ladder, the outcome is being regarded as an unfortunate ending as the seven-year-old furniture portal was once viewed as a top vertical ecommerce site, having raised a record $ 50 million in 2015. But business had soured for the company, as larger players including Amazon and Flipkart launched private label furniture brands and other niche vertical ecommerce rivals proliferated. Urban Ladder reported a net loss of Rs 49 crore on its total turnover of Rs 434 crore in fiscal year 2019.

Stung by the competition, Urban Ladder was looking to raise fresh capital and explored sale options with strategic investors for over a year such as FabIndia, Flipkart and Amazon, sources said. But as the talks failed to fructify, the company had to restructure its business to cut costs in order to stay afloat, the people said.

In October 2019, cofounder Srivatsa left the company, the exit of Kalaari Capital’s Vani Kola from the board of the company.

The startup also moved towards a lower cost price point to stay competitive, laid off a fourth of its workforce, and shut down high-cost initiatives such as cash-on-delivery, and operations in several cities, CEO Goel had told ET in an earlier interaction. He had declined to comment on the sale talks.

Competition in India’s online furniture market has risen in recent years following big investments in the space by Flipkart and Amazon and the entry of global furniture brand IKEA. This has led to increased discounting, significantly hurting margins of brands and vertical players.

""With 90% of the furniture industry still unorganized in India and leading business houses like Reliance showing strong interest in this domain shows that there is high potential in this space and there is big gap which needs to fill in a more organized way,"" said Lokendra Ranawat, CEO, WoodenStreet. The deal will deepen the competition in the sector, he said."

"Sensex Falls Over 250 Pts in Early Trade, Nifty Slips Below 12,650; IndusInd Bank Top Loser",News18,https://www.news18.com/news/india/sensex-falls-over-250-pts-in-early-trade-nifty-slips-below-12650-indusind-bank-top-loser-3076514.html,"LAST UPDATED:
NOVEMBER 13, 2020, 10:44 IST","Mumbai: Equity benchmark Sensex dropped over 250 points in early trade on Friday, tracking losses in index-heavyweights HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank amid weak cues from global markets. The market is taking a pause at these levels with higher possibility of profit-booking, experts said.
The 30-share BSE index was trading 251.44 points or 0.58 per cent lower at 43,105.75. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slipped 68.95 points or 0.54 per cent to 12,621.85.
IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 3 per cent, followed by SBI, L&T, Axis Bank, HDFC twins, Kotak Bank and ICICI Bank. On the other hand, Asian Paints, Reliance Industries, Titan, Bajaj Finance and Sun Pharma were trading with gains.
In the previous session, Sensex ended 236.48 points or 0.54 per cent lower at 43,357.19, while Nifty slipped 58.35 points or 0.46 per cent to 12,690.80. Foreign institutional investors remained net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 1,514.12 crore on Thursday, according to provisional exchange data.
Trade set up in India does not look to be inspiring as global markets are trading lower now taking cues from US equities, said Arjun Yash Mahajan Head Institutional Business at Reliance Securities. Amid profit-booking, the market did not react much yesterday after the announcement of fiscal stimulus under Aatmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 by the Finance Ministry, he said.
Meanwhile, industrial production entered positive territory after a gap of six months, mainly due to higher output in mining and power sectors, official data showed on Thursday. The industrial output grew by 0.2 per cent in September, according to the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data.
On the global front, US equities ended lower as investors turned cautious due to continued rise in COVID-19 cases and possibilities of further restriction on businesses in a large way. Additionally, dimming prospects of early fiscal stimulus due to Donald Trump's hard stance on US election result outcome may not result in smooth transition for the new government, also weighed on investors' sentiments, Mahajan added.
Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo were trading with losses in mid-session deals, while Seoul was positive. International oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 1.59 per cent lower at USD 42.84 per barrel.

This is the first investment by Reliance Industries after Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a 15-year vision of building Reliance as a new energy company, at the annual general meeting on July 15.
“BEV seeks to find solutions to the climate crisis by flexibly investing to develop breakthrough energy and agriculture technologies. BEV will invest the funds raised from the investors to support innovation in clean energy solutions. The results of these efforts would have significant relevance for India and are expected to benefit the entire mankind and also provide good returns to the investors,” Reliance said in a statement.
BEV is a limited partnership newly incorporated company under the State laws of Delaware, home to US President-elect Joe Biden.
The capital contribution commitment of $50 million constitutes 5.75 per cent of the size of the fund contemplated at present. The said investment will be made in tranches over the next 8-10 years.
The transaction is subject to approval from the Reserve Bank of India.
At the AGM, Mukesh Ambani gave a peek into Reliance's long-term vision of steering the company “beyond oil to chemicals” and how he is “re-imagining” the entire energy platform.
“The catastrophic impact of climate change calls for the legacy energy industry to reinvent itself on a war footing. Furthermore, the world needs access to clean and affordable energy and this must be met, as it is a pre-requisite to ensuring quality of life for all people. To meet these twin challenges, the energy industry must understand that fossil fuels and renewables are not mutually exclusive or contradictory,” he told shareholders at the annual general meeting on July 15.
India’s fuel mix is dominated by thermal power (64 per cent), followed by renewable energy sources (22 per cent), hydro (13 per cent), and nuclear (1 per cent).
Reliance, Ambani said, will build an optimal mix of reliable, clean and affordable energy with hydrogen, wind, solar, fuel cells and battery. It will combine the strengths in digital, power electronics, advanced materials and electrochemistry to develop full stack electrolyser and fuel cell solutions.
“Transforming our energy business to tackle one of the biggest challenges before India and the world is our new growth opportunity. On successful implementation of this strategy, we target to become net carbon-zero by 2035,” he said on July 15.
“This model envisages a large coalition of global financial investors, reputed technology partners and start-ups working on futuristic solutions,” he said.
“The new energy business based on the principle of carbon recycle and circular economy is a multi-trillion opportunity for India and the world. It is also an opportunity to make clean and green energy abundantly available at an affordable price to every Indian, every Indian enterprise and every Indian utility,” he added.

Why Has Reliance Industries Gained 130% Since March? - Investing.com India,Investing.com,https://in.investing.com/news/why-has-reliance-industries-gained-130-since-march-2503181,"Investing.com
Stock Market News
2020-11-12 04:15","By Aditya Raghunath
Investing.com -- Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) is India’s largest company in terms of market cap and the stock has soared a phenomenal 130% since March 2020. RIL stock began the year at Rs. 1,500 and soon fell to a 52-week low of Rs 867.4 as the Nifty and BSE Sensex plunged close to 40% due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower oil prices.
However, since then the stock has made a strong comeback and touched a record of Rs 2,369.35 in September. So what’s driven this massive surge in Reliance Industries?
Billion-dollar investments by a slew of foreign investors
Several global heavyweights have pumped in billions of dollars to get a slice of the Jio dream. Launched back in 2016, Jio is now the leading telecom operator in India and has attracted investments from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), and Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Private equity firms such as KKR and Silver Lake have also invested in Jio.
In the last six months, Reliance Industries has raised approximately Rs 170,000 crore or $23 billion in strategic investments.
However, Reliance remains an energy-focused company and generates the majority of its sales from the refining and marketing of oil. This is followed by its petrochemicals business, organized retail, telecom, and media businesses.
Is Reliance debt-free?
Mukesh Ambani previously aimed to make Reliance Industries net-debt free by the end of this fiscal year. While this idea would have seemed absurd at the start of 2020, the above investments have managed the company to attain its financial goal well before March 2021.
While Reliance still has debt on its books, the company has enough liquidity to cover its liabilities and continue to invest in growth and capital expenditure.
Reliance will be a key player in the transition towards 5G technology and the rebound in oil prices in the upcoming months coupled with its strong balance sheet should be key drivers of its stock price."
"CCI approves Google’s Rs 33,737 crore deal with Jio",Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/cci-approves-google-rs-33737-crore-deal-jio-develop-smartphone/story/421735.html,"BusinessToday.In | November 12, 2020 | Updated 00:13 IST","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday said it has approved US internet giant Google's proposal to acquire 7.73 per cent stake in billionaire Mueskh Ambani-led Jio Platforms. The approval paves way for Google to jointly develop Android smartphones in India. The US-based firm will be making the investment into the digital arm of Reliance Industries through its wholly-owned subsidiary Google International LLC (GIL).
""Commission approves acquisition of 7.73 per cent equity share capital of Jio Platforms by Google,"" CCI said in a tweet.
The regulatory approval came about four months after the two companies made the announcement. In July, Google had announced to invest Rs 33,737 crore to acquire a minority non-controlling shareholding of around 7.7 per cent in the Reliance Industries' technology venture. The US-based internet major had moved the CII in September to get an all-clear for its investment in Jio Platforms.
Google was the 14th investor to invest in Jio Platforms after Facebook, Qualcomm and Intel. Facebook, Silver Lake Partners (two investments), Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton, PIF, Intel Capital and Qualcomm Ventures are the other companies that have invested in Jio Platforms.
The watchdog has already approved Facebook's acquisition of 9.99 per cent in Jio Platforms for Rs 43,574 crore, a move which would strengthen social media giant's presence in its largest market.
Jio Platforms has raised over Rs 1.52 lakh crore fund by divesting minority stakes to multiple technology companies which includes tech giants, private equity players and sovereign wealth funds.

Why RIL share fell over 5% today,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/ril-share-falls-amazon-future-retail-insider-trading-sebi-probe/story/421722.html,"BusinessToday.In | November 11, 2020 | Updated 18:49 IST","Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) share closed below Rs 2,000 after six trading sessions as Amazon.com Inc asked Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to investigate Future Retail for insider trading as it seeks to prevent its business partner from becoming part of rival Reliance's empire. The US giant has been pressing the SEBI to review Reliance's August deal to buy retail, logistics and other assets from Future Group for $3.4 billion including debt.
On November 2, RIL share closed below Rs 2,000 after the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate announced Q2 earnings. The stock closed 8.62% or Rs 177 lower at Rs 1877 on BSE against previous close of Rs 2054. In today's trade, RIL share closed 4.20% or Rs 87.60 lower at Rs 1,996 against previous close of Rs 2084 on BSE. Stock has fallen after 5 days of consecutive gain. The large cap stock touched an intraday low of Rs 1979, down 5.06%.
Delhi HC seeks Amazon's response on Future Retail's suit
The large cap share trades higher than 5 day and 200 day moving averages but lower than 20 day, 50 day and 100 day moving averages. The large cap share has gained 39.86% in one year and risen 31.89% since the beginning of this year. The share has lost 10.6% in a month.
Total 8.11 lakh shares changed hands amounting to turnover of Rs 164.70 crore. Market cap of the firm fell to Rs 13.50 lakh crore.
Amazon argues it had a 2019 agreement with Future which prevented the Indian group's retail assets from being sold to certain parties including Reliance Industries. The November 8 letter to SEBI alleges Future Retail disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of an injunction granted by a Singapore arbitrator to block the deal.
The spat is being closely watched as a key test of whether Indian firms, courts and regulators will respect arbitration decisions made in accordance with overseas arbitration rules, and adds to headaches for Amazon in India which is also dealing with antitrust challenges.

Premji pipped HCL Technologies’ Shiv Nadar, who had earlier topped the list collated by Hurun Report India and Edelgive Foundation, by a wide margin. Nadar’s donations stood at Rs 795 crore for FY20 as against Rs 826 crore in the year-ago period. Premji had donated Rs 426 crore in the previous fiscal.
Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries retained the third spot among the list of givers by donating Rs 458 crore as against Rs 402 crore a year ago, it said.
The raging pandemic had the corporate honchos repurposing their donations to fight the COVID infections, and the top giver on this turned out to be Tata Sons with a Rs 1,500- crore commitment, followed by Premji at Rs 1,125 crore and Ambani’s Rs 510 crore.
A bulk of the corporate commitments seemed to be given to the PM-CARES Fund, with Reliance Industries committing Rs 500 crore, and Aditya Birla Group donating Rs 400 crore, the report said. It can be noted that Tatas’ commitment also includes a Rs 500 crore donation to the newly created fund.
Premji’s generosity pulled the total donations up by 175 per cent to Rs 12,050 crore in FY20, the list said.
Azim Premji Endowment Fund owns 13.6 per cent of the promoter’s shareholding in Wipro and has the right to receive all money earned from promoter shares, the report said.
The number of individuals who have donated more than Rs 10 crore increased marginally to 78 from the year-ago period’s 72, the report said.
With a donation of Rs 27 crore, Amit Chandra and Archana Chandra of ATE Chandra foundation are the first and only professional managers to ever enter the list.
The list has three of Infosys’ co-founders with Nandan Nilekani (Rs 159 crore), S Gopalkrishnan (Rs 50 crore) and S D Shibulal (Rs 32 crore).
The list of 109 individuals who have donated over Rs 5 crore has seven women, led by Rohini Nilekani’s Rs 47 crore.
Education is the highest beneficiary sector with 90 philanthropists, led by Premji and Nadar, donating Rs 9,324 crore, the report said, adding healthcare came second with 84 donors and was followed by disaster relief and rehabilitation with 41 donors.
The financial capital led by donor count at 36, followed by New Delhi at 20 and Bengaluru at 10.

Indices fell 40 percent from the record high levels to hit a low in March.
The market got a boost after the government started the Unlock process in June. The liquidity flow and positive global cues also lifted the sentiment.
Nifty and Sensex have made fresh record highs this week with Sensex scaling the 43,000-mark for the first time. But the upward journey from March to November was not broad-based as only two sectors saw substantial gains.
IT and Pharma looked strong from last record high in January to current record high in November, rising 29 percent and 35 percent, respectively. And the rest are still in the red during same period as of publishing this article.
It meant that only few stocks drove this recovery - major ones were Reliance Industries, TCS and Infosys, which are index heavyweights.

Tribunal Dismisses Reliance Industries’ Appeal Against SEBI Order,Bloomberg Quint,https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/insider-trading-case-sat-dismisses-reliance-industries-appeal-against-sebi-order,"Nov 05 2020, 1:31 PM","The Securities Appellate Tribunal has dismissed an appeal filed by Reliance Industries Ltd., challenging a disgorgement order passed by the market regulator.
The appeal emanates from an order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India which directed the company to disgorge an amount of Rs 447.27 crore, along with interest at 12%, on grounds that the oil-to-gas major made unlawful gains from a transaction where it offloaded 5% of its then holding in Reliance Petroleum Ltd., in March 2007.
A two-member majority comprising MT Joshi and CKG Nair directed Reliance Industries to pay the disgorged amount within 60 days of the order along with 12% interest, effective from November 2007 till the actual date of payment to SEBI.
Reliance Industries disclosed in a stock exchange filing on Nov. 5 that the appellate tribunal, by a 2:1 majority, has dismissed its appeal.
“All trades carried out by the company were genuine and bona fide. No irregularity can be attached to these transactions. The company reiterates that it has not violated any law or regulation while selling shares of RPL in November 2007,” the company said in a statement.
SAT’s Findings
To recap, the market regulator had alleged in its order that Reliance Industries enlisted the services of 12 companies as an agent for taking “huge short positions” in 2007 November futures derivatives of Reliance Petroleum. Further, RIL executed separate agreements with each of the 12 companies under which they earned commission while all profits and losses were transferred to RIL’s account, SEBI had said in its March 2017 order.
After concluding its investigation, SEBI’s whole-time member also made the following allegations against Reliance Industries:
By employing 12 entities to take separate short positions in November 2007 RPL futures, Reliance Industries did not engage in a hedging strategy. It was in fact a “pre-planned fraudulent scheme” for cornering positions and manipulation of the futures. This act, as per the regulator, cannot be considered as mere breach of position limits.
The oil-to-gas major sold more 1.95 crore RPL shares in the cash segment during the last 10 minutes of the trading session on Nov. 29, 2007. This was done to depress the weighted average price during the last 30 minutes of trading in order to make gains on outstanding short positions held by the company.
The company made unlawful gains of Rs 513 crore as a result.
Harish Salve, senior counsel representing Reliance Industries and 12 other appellants, questioned SEBI’s findings on the following grounds:
Reliance Industries had decided to offload a 5% stake in Reliance Petroleum and took a hedge position to cover the possibility of price fall in the cash segment. As such, the presence of an underlying exposure means that the hedge cannot be termed as a manipulation or speculation.
The company took a reasonable hedge and engaged 12 front entities to take net short position limits. This engagement for taking position in the F&O segment was not contrary to the stock exchange regulations and was a valid action as per the Indian Contract Act.
SEBI’s findings that Reliance Industries violated the Prevention of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practice regulations was erroneous as it failed to prove if exceeding position limits can be termed as market manipulation or fraud.
And lastly, an element of inducement is necessary to prove charges of fraud. However, in the current case the total trades undertaken by the company and its agents constituted only 8% of the total trades in futures segment, which were done in a bona-fide manner.
Reading into the past rulings of the apex court on hedging , a two-member majority of the tribunal, while dismissing Reliance Industries’ arguments observed that:
12 companies engaged by Reliance Industries as agents were distinct entities. SEBI’s surveillance mechanism could not have detected them as agents of Reliance Industries.
RIL, along with its 12 agent entities had cornered a substantial portion of the market wide position limits ranging from 62% to 93% on different trading days. This conduct, as per the tribunal, was a pre-planned strategy of manipulation as it was unknown to other market participants. The breach cannot be treated as mere violation of market limits.
The tribunal dismissed RIL’s argument that its trades in derivatives was a hedging strategy. While doing so, it noted that while market participants with an underlying exposure are free to hedge their position, they cannot use a scheme or device to corner a substantial portion of the position limit and squeeze the market.
Based on such factors, it can be concluded that the scheme utilised by the petroleum major and its agents was fraudulent and manipulative.
Justice Tarun Agarwala, the presiding officer of the tribunal, gave a dissenting opinion by concluding that SEBI failed to discharge the burden of establishing manipulation by Reliance Industries. SEBI’s disgorgement order is without any authority of law and must be set aside to that extent, Justice Agarwala noted in his dissenting opinion, while partially allowing the oil and gas major’s appeal."

"RIL top Sensex gainer today, share price jumps over 3.5% after Saudi PIF investment in Reliance Retail",Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/ril-top-sensex-gainer-today-mukesh-ambani-reliance-industries-share-price-jumps-3-after-saudi-pif-investment-in-reliance-retail/2122153/,"Updated: Nov 06, 2020 4:42 PM","This recent investment in RRVL follows PIF’s earlier acquisition of a 2.32 per cent stake in Jio Platforms, the digital services subsidiary of Reliance Industries
Currently, new gas fields (those other than the nominated fields) make up for less than fifth of the natural gas produced in the country, but these are expected to increase their share significantly in the coming years.
RIL share price jumped 3 per cent to Rs 2,013.75 apiece intraday on BSE, a day after the Mukesh Ambani-led firm announced that The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will invest Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail for an equity stake of 2.04 per cent. Earlier this week, RIL shares plunged 9 per cent, since then the stock has managed to gain 7.2 per cent. Today’s surge in the stock price was fuelled by the investment announcement by Saudi PIF in RIL’s retail business. So far, Reliance Industries Ltd has raised Rs 47,265 crore by selling 10.26 per cent stake in Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL). “Similar to previous investment, we understand this is fresh capital infusion in RRVL. We have ascribed Rs 4.4t equity value to RRVL, thus, this deal is valued at 4 per cent premium to our valuation, implying Rs 639 per share of RRVL for 90 per cent stake, taking our target price for RIL marginally up,” said Hemang Jani, Head- Equity Strategy, B&D, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
This recent investment in RRVL follows PIF’s earlier acquisition of a 2.32 per cent stake in Jio Platforms, the digital services subsidiary of Reliance Industries. RRVL is RIL’s 90 per cent subsidiary with rev/EBITDA of Rs 1,629b / INR97b for FY20. “Its core rev/EBITDA including grocery, fashion and electronics stands at INR928b/INR86.3b,” Hemang Jani said. The firm has on-boarded over half a dozen global companies including Silver Lake, KKR, General Atlantic, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, GIC, TPG and ADIA.

Editors Pick","Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) is one of the few stocks that have benefitted majorly from the Covid crises. Drastic changes in the company’s business model, diversification from the Energy segment to the Retail segment are the two major themes driving the Price Action. However, from the last couple of days, we can witness a downtrend in Stock Prices; it’s a Short term downtrend. Prices have declined almost 22% from the peak value, even though it’s a drastic fall, still, it’s not a good idea to take a short trade in Reliance, at least from my point of view! Here’s why – Take a look at this Chart Analysis.

Price Action Analysis on Reliance Industries – 4h Chart


After testing the low of 1850, we can see a quick bounce back in Stock Prices. Along with that, the volume has also significantly increased. A combination of a sudden increase in the Volume and a quick bounce back in stock prices technically indicates the buying pressure on the stock.

But keep in mind, just because there is Buying pressure doesn’t mean that stock prices are going to shoot up. In order for the Buyers to take complete control over the market sentiment, Prices should break above the potential resistance at 2050 and must retest it clearly to go higher. On the other hand, a break below 1850 might push the stock prices into a further selloff or Sideways Behavior. Just keep an eye on the Price Action and Trade Accordingly in the coming days."

Insider trading: SAT upholds SEBI disgorgement order against Reliance Industries,The Hindu Businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/sat-uphelds-sebi-order-against-ril/article33031994.ece,"November 05, 2020","SEBI’s disgorgement order against Reliance Industries (RIL) in an insider trading case has been upheld by the Securities Appellate Tribunal. SAT said RIL’s appeal lacks any merit. The company said it will challenge the SAT ruling in Supreme Court.
In 2017, SEBI had directed RIL to pay ₹447.27 crore along with 12 per cent interest for induling in insider trading in the shares of Reliance Petroleum (RPL) in 2007. The total disgorgement amount comes to around ₹2,000 crore.

SEBI’s internal surveillance team had spotted suspicious trades by RIL and some entities linked to it. SEBI said that RIL had enlisted the services of 12 companies as agents for taking “huge short positions” in the equity derivatives segment for RPL in 2007. SEBI found that RIL had executed separate agreements with each of them, under which they earned commission while all profits and losses were transferred to RIL.
On its part, Reliance said: “All trades carried out by the company were genuine and bona fide. No irregularity can be attached to these transactions”.
When these entities went short on RPL shares, RIL was offloading 5 per cent stake in the company, which put pressure on the market price at the same time, SEBI had observed.
‘Disgorgement is not penalty’
RIL had contended that disgorgement was a punishment/penalty, while powers granted to SEBI under Section 11B of SEBI Act are remedial in nature.
Therefore, no order for disgorgement could have been passed. “We do not agree with this contention at all. In the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014 effected from July 18, 2013, it is clearly stated that power of disgorgement, an amount equivalent to the wrongful gain made or loss averted by such contravention was always with SEBI,” SAT said. According to SAT, it is an equitable remedy; not a penal action.
RIL had argued that it was in a tearing hurry to sell 5 per cent stake in RPL in November 2007 as three analysts found the share price of RPL overvalued.
“It is an irony that outside analysts, who basically produce their reports for general investors, and not for promoters who are insiders, knew more than the insiders and the insiders placed their full bet on such analyst reports,” SAT said.
Deepak Sanchety, Ex Head of Surveillance, SEBI, said, “it is absolutely legitimate for any entity to first sell in futures and lock the price and then undertake sale of underlying shares. Further, agency trades are also not barred in Indian markets. The limit of open position for one entity is merely a risk management measure. I’m surprised that SAT could not be persuaded to see the trades in the correct perspective. This will have direct implication on other proceedings, if any, approved in the matter.”"

Reliance Industries to appeal in Supreme Court against SAT ruling,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/reliance-industries-to-appeal-in-supreme-court-against-sat-ruling-120110500724_1.html,"Last Updated at November 5, 2020 13:45 IST","Reliance Industries on Thursday said it will challenge in Supreme Court the dismissal of its plea by the Securities Appellate Tribunal against a Sebi ruling barring the firm and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives for alleged unfair trade practices.
SAT, by a 2:1 majority order, has dismissed RIL's appeal against the Sebi order dated March 24, 2017, in the matter relating to the sale of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) shares by the company in November 2007, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run firm said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
""The company will examine the order passed by SAT,"" it said.
""All trades carried out by the company were genuine and bona fide. No irregularity can be attached to these transactions,"" it added.
RIL also said it has not violated any law or regulation while selling shares of RPL in November 2007.
""The company, under proper legal advice, will prefer an appeal to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and is confident of vindicating its position,"" it said.
Through the order on March 24, 2017, Sebi had barred RIL and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives for alleged unfair trade practices related to the securities market. The securities market regulator had also directed RIL to disgorge Rs 447 crore along with interest.
RIL had in March 2007 decided to sell 4.1 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum Ltd, a listed subsidiary which was later merged with RIL in 2009. But, to prevent a plunge in the RPL share price, the equity was apparently sold first in the futures market and later in the spot market.

Amazon-Future coupons deal named 15 companies as untouchables,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/amazon-future-coupons-deal-named-15-cos-as-untouchables/articleshow/79052969.cms,"Last Updated: Nov 05, 2020, 07:41 AM IST","Mumbai: Amazon's shareholders' agreement with Future Coupons had barred not just Reliance Industries but tens of companies including Walmart, Google and Zomato from buying into Future Group’s retail assets. The US ecommerce giant had explicitly named 15 global and local firms including Walmart, Alibaba, Softbank, Google, Naspers, eBay, Target, Paytm, Zomato and Swiggy as parties which cannot buy shares or stake in Future Coupons (FCL), a holding company of Future Group, according to Amazon-Future Retail shareholder agreement submitted to the Singapore arbitration court. In addition, anyone engaged in online or offline retail of either food or non-food in India or globally was barred from buying into FCL. ET has reviewed a copy of the order.

The Kishore Biyani-owned Future Group had in August agreed to sell its retail and wholesale assets to Reliance Retail Ventures in an all-cash deal worth Rs 24,713 crore. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre had in an interim ruling last month directed Future Group to put the proposal to sell the retail business to Reliance on hold until it gives a final judgement on a plea filed by Amazon. “The respondents are injuncted from issuing securities of Future Retail or obtaining and securing any financing, directly or indirectly, from any restricted person,” it said. Some legal experts said such blanket restriction can be rendered as void by court.

“While entering into a share purchase agreement, parties are free to agree to a reasonable restriction on transfer of shares to competitors, etc. However, the restriction cannot be a blanket restriction to include all persons engaged in a similar business,” said Ashish K Singh, managing partner at law firm Capstone Legal. “Such a blanket restriction is in restraint of trade and can be rendered as void by court's intervention.”

The Singapore arbitration court ruled that while Amazon was aware of Future Retail's discussions with Reliance, it had no details on the contours, nature and specifics of the potential deal. It also said the disputed transaction is with a competitor that Amazon had expressly singled out as a restricted person and the parties unequivocally agreed to this investment parameter. In response to ET’s request for comment, an Amazon spokesperson said, “As a responsible investor and a long term player in India, Amazon complies with foreign direct investment laws and seeks regulatory approvals including from the Competition Commission of India.”"

An industry veteran with over 19 years of experience across companies such as Maruti Suzuki and General Electric, Gupta in his most recent stint served as Executive Vice President and CFO of e-commerce logistics startup Ecom Express.

“Mayank is an accomplished executive with significant strategic, financial and operational expertise. With his strong experiences, solid pedigree and a very accomplished track record, we are confident that Mayank will contribute to the next level growth at 1mg,” said Prashant Tandon, cofounder and CEO at 1mg.

At General Electric, he had served as the CFO of GE’s South Asia oil and gas, and transportation and aviation businesses. Gupta had at GE led the Boston-headquartered manufacturing giant to bag one of the largest “Make in India” project from the Indian Railways.

“1mg represents the cutting edge of Indian digital healthcare ecosystem and has built the best in class team. It is a great opportunity to join the 1mg leadership team at such a time, especially when healthcare assumes significant mind space for all of us,” said Gupta.

Gupta’s appointment at 1mg comes as the sector has seen a wave of consolidation, with Reliance Industries acquiring Chennai-based Netmeds and Pharmeasy merging with smaller rival MedLife. 1mg is said to be banking on the proliferation of India’s Health Stack, of which it is a key member through the Swasth alliance, to grow.

Amazon too has made an entry into the prescription drug delivery business, with its largest vendor Cloudtail acquiring a pharmacy license and having begun delivering drugs to customer homes in Bengaluru."

Editors Pick","Our ADD rating on Reliance Industries Ltd (NS: RELI )with a price target of INR 2,140 /sh is premised on (1) induction of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) as partners in Jio Platform, which should enable the company to accelerate the growth of digital connectivity and create value in the digital ecosystem through technology offerings, (2) recovery in refining and petchem businesses in FY22E, (3) the emergence of a clear path to a stronger balance sheet, and (4) stake sale in the retail business.
RIL reported standalone revenue/EBITDA of INR 563/76bn, -35/-44% YoY (in line with our estimates). Standalone APAT stood at INR 65bn, -33% YoY (HSIE est: INR 36bn). The deviation in APAT from the estimates was mainly due to the tax expense reversal on account of a reduction in the annual effective tax rate for FY21.
Standalone refining segment: Crude throughput declined 8/8% YoY/QoQ to 15.3mmt. GRM stood at USD 5.7/bbl, down from USD 6.3/bbl in 1Q. The sequential decline in the refining margin was due to lower cracks across products. RIL's GRMs outperformed Singapore GRM by USD 5.7/bbl (as against USD 7.2/bbl in 1Q).
Standalone petrochemical segment: Production during 2Q was 9.7mmt, - 2/+9% YoY/QoQ. Petchem EBITDA was INR 59bn, -33% YoY given pricing pressure because of disruptions in the local and global markets. EBITDA/t stood at INR 6,052 (vs. INR 8,839/4,860 YoY/QoQ)
RJio: Revenue grew by ~33/6% YoY/QoQ to INR 175bn. ARPU rose to INR 145 (+14/3% YoY/QoQ) while the gross/net subscriber addition was ~27/7mn. We expect ARPU to increase to INR 148/160 in FY21/22E owing to the tariff hike in Dec-19.
Reliance (NS: RELI ) Retail (RR): Recovery from the pandemic has been encouraging across categories. Revenue nearly hit base quarter levels (Rs. 411bn). 85% of stores are now operational (1Q: 50%), of which half are fully operational. Footfalls clocked 75% of pre-covid levels (vs 43% in 1Q). Consumer Electronics (CE) doubled, and Fashion & Lifestyle (F&L) tripled their toplines respectively from their 1QFY21 lows (Yet to recoup base quarter sales). Grocery and connectivity continued their strong growth momentum. EBITDAM expanded 160bp QoQ to 5.4% as the mix sharply improved in favor of the high margin CE and F&L segment. (Note: EBITDAM still remains 90bp short of 2QFY20 levels).

RIL’s consolidated profit (attributable to owners of the company) of ₹9,567 crore was about 15 per cent lower y-o-y and 28 per cent lower compared with the June 2020 quarter. That the consolidated profit was below the psychological level of ₹10,000 crore might have unsettled some. But this was due to the far higher share of minority interest (₹1,035 crore) in the September 2020 quarter compared with the September 2019 quarter (₹90 crore) and the June 2020 quarter (₹15 crore).
The higher share of minority interest is primarily due to the stake sale of about 33 per cent in Jio Platforms in the past few months. That the digital business (Jio) was the largest profit contributor in the recent September quarter accentuated the difference between pre-minority and post-minority profit. The total consolidated profit (before minority interest) in the September 2020 quarter is ₹10,602 crore, down about 7 per cent y-o-y and 20 per cent compared with the June 2020 quarter. On a y-o-y basis, only the digital segment’s operating profit grew while that of the petrochemicals, refining and retail segments fell.
Exceptional gain
Two – a weak sequential quarter performance (September 2020 over June 2020) by RIL in contrast to many other companies that have recovered well with the unlocking of the economy. But this was due to an exceptional gain in the June 2020 quarter, of ₹4,966 crore due to profit on divestment of shares of Reliance BP Mobility Services.
Adjusted for this, RIL’s consolidated profit (attributable to shareholders) in the September 2020 quarter is about 16 per cent higher compared with the June 2020 quarter.
Catching up with valuation
Three – disappointment in the performance of a stock priced-to-perfection. The RIL stock has had a stupendous run since end-March. From a low of ₹884 on March 23 this year, the stock rocketed to over ₹2,300 in September 2020 - thanks to the mega stake sale deals in Jio Platforms, the big-ticket rights issue, the recent major stake sales in Reliance Retail, and the announcement of Reliance Retail buying the chunk of Future’s business.
The valuation (price to trailing 12 month earnings) of the RIL stock shot up to over 30 times, far higher than its three-year average of about 20 times. At these levels, there was little room for bad news. So, the news of the Reliance – Future Retail deal being stayed by an emergency arbitrator in Singapore in the tussle with Amazon saw the RIL stock lose ground over the past week. Add to this the market disappointment with the company’s September quarter results, and the RIL stock fell off the cliff.
Even after the crash, the RIL stock trades at close to 30 times."

Mukesh Ambani slips to 9th spot in Forbes billionaires list a day after RIL’s share tanked 9%,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/mukesh-ambani-slips-to-9th-spot-in-forbes-billionaires-list-a-day-after-rils-share-tanked-9,": Tuesday, November 3, 2020, 1:51 PM IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani slipped to the 9th spot in the Forbes billionaires ranking after Reliance Industries Ltd's (RIL) shares tumbled the most in over seven months following a drop in quarterly profit.
Mukesh Ambani lost almost USD 7 billion from his net worth as the RIL's shares tanked nearly 9 per cent on Monday after the company reported a 15 per cent drop in second quarter net profit.
According to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, the total net worth of Mukesh Ambani, as on November 3, stands at USD 71.5 billion. He slipped to the ninth position, in the top ten billionaires’ list, from the sixth spot.

"Jeff Bezos, Mukesh Ambani in battle over Future Group",Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/jeff-bezos-mukesh-ambani-in-battle-over-future-group/story-cy8XTnjDfRT3DWTeleaBvO.html,"UPDATED ON NOV 03, 2020 01:35 PM IST","A vanilla commercial dispute is setting the stage for a clash between the world’s No. 1 and No. 6 richest men. But the legal wrangling is a sideshow. What Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani are really fighting over is pole position in the only billion-plus-people consumer market available to both of them: India.
The ostensible battleground is a $3.4 billion deal Indian tycoon Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. stitched up in August to acquire assets of debt-laden local retailer Future Group. Bezos’s Amazon.com Inc. is trying to block the transaction.
That, in itself, is a bit of a dampener. Expectations were building for the two billionaires to work together. In September, Bloomberg News reported that Ambani had given Amazon an option to buy as much as 40% of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd., seeking to repeat the success he had earlier this year in bringing in Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. as partners to his digital platform.
By seeking to stall Ambani’s purchase of Future, Bezos may be signaling that he would rather remain a rival. Or, that he’s buying time to sweeten the offer currently on the table.
The actual quarrel is only interesting when you read between the lines of the claims and counterclaims.Amazon bought a 49% stake last year in a private firm controlled by Kishore Biyani, a pioneer of modern-format retailing in the country. The investment gave the U.S. e-commerce giant the right to acquire Biyani’s shares in the publicly traded Future Retail Ltd. from the third year. Another of Bezos’s conditions was that Biyani wouldn’t sell his assets — about 1,500 stores nationwide — to restricted persons, including Reliance, which operates India’s largest retail chain.
After the Future-Reliance deal was announced, Amazon alleged breach of contract and obtained an interim stay against the sale from an arbitrator in Singapore, a preferred neutral venue in Asia for settling disputes in cross-border agreements. The U.S. company then wrote a letter to Indian stock exchanges and the regulator, asking them to not approve the transaction.
Future Retail has challenged Amazon’s position by saying that the Singapore ruling has no legal basis in India, and that anyway, it wasn’t a party to the founder’s agreement. Given the debilitating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on operations, the retailer says it’s doing the right thing by all stakeholders in selling assets to Reliance. As for Amazon’s claim of $193 million in damages plus interest, that liability, if awarded by the arbitrator, should fall on Biyani’s private firm that did the deal, Future Retail argues.
Biyani is just a pawn in a much bigger power play. Future’s cash crunch didn’t emerge suddenly. Amazon had ample opportunity to tiptoe around India’s legal restrictions on foreign ownership of retail chains to act as a white knight. But it didn’t.
Amazon may still be interested in partnering with Ambani — at the right price. Other investors, such as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co., have written him checks worth $5 billion in total. They may have feared losing out on what could become India’s most successful mix of physical and digital shopping, a strategy that leverages Reliance Retail’s own outlets together with independently owned neighborhood stores connected to Ambani’s 4G phone network of 400 million users. However, the portion offered to Amazon would mean a $20 billion commitment. Bezos could afford to see how well Ambani executes his plan.
Amazon’s India website kicked off its annual festival season last month to record sales in the first couple of days. Reliance Retail’s revenue also jumped 30% in the September quarter from the previous three months. But although India’s nationwide lockdown has ended, not all stores have reopened fully. Footfall has yet to recover, especially in fashion and lifestyle and at stores inside malls. In Macquarie’s estimates, the next fiscal year’s earnings per share for Reliance Industries, the holding company, may be 23% below the consensus street forecast. A reason, the brokerage says, is stiff competition, high investment and low margins in retail. Reliance Industries shares fell 8.6% in Mumbai on Monday. 
Amazon’s letter to the Securities and Exchange Board of India makes a reference to India’s “ease of doing business,” which has been a sore point with foreign investors from Vodafone Group Plc to Cairn Energy Plc. The regulator needs to hold listed firms accountable for their dealings, Amazon said in the letter, according to Reuters, which has seen a copy.
The last thing India wants is more of a bad rap. The Seattle-based firm already has to operate with one hand tied behind its back: As a foreign e-commerce player, it can’t own inventory or openly discount merchandise. Even harsher rules — covering data and algorithms — may be on their way. It’s important for regulators to not give Amazon the chance to paint a commercial feud as another sign of India’s unfair treatment of global investors.
In more ways than one, a waiting game by Bezos may not be a bad idea.

On Friday, Ambani was at sixth spot on the list. As per Forbes' real-time net worth data, Ambani's fortune fell by $6.8 billion to $71.5 billion after RIL stock ended 8.62% or Rs 177 lower at Rs 1877  on BSE.
Business magnate Elon Musk stood at fifth position on the list with a net worth of $87 billion followed by billionaire investor Warren Buffet with net worth of $76.2 billion.

RIL is currently working on three projects in the KG-D6 block, where production from older fields was halted in February this year. Of the three fields, R-Series will be the first to go live.
The Mumbai-headquartered oil-to-telecom conglomerate said in an investor presentation after announcing its second-quarter earnings that all wells have been ""drilled, completed, tested and connected"" and all ""sub-sea installation and testing works (have been) completed.""

An official of a firm which has contracted gas from the field, said Reliance had previously indicated November as the month for start of production.
Gas from R-Series field was previously expected in June but COVID-19 lockdown disrupted the supply chain and the company could not complete the project in time.
Reliance and its partner BP are developing three sets of discoveries in the KG-D6 block - R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022. Peak output of around 28 million standard cubic metres per day is expected by FY24 when all three projects are up and running.

Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period, and the volume of gas required.

Reliance Industries to Start Gas Production from R-Series Field in November-December,News18,https://www.news18.com/news/business/reliance-industries-to-start-gas-production-from-r-series-field-in-november-december-3035999.html,"LAST UPDATED:
NOVEMBER 03, 2020, 08:02 IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries plans to start the delayed production from the second wave of discoveries in its eastern offshore KG-D6 block in November/December, the company said in an investor presentation.

MJ field will start production in third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd. Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.
Sources said Reliance had in November set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price — which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
Considering current average Brent price of USD 40 per barrel, the gas will cost around USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit.
Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made. In the first round of auction in November 2019, Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL bought a majority of volumes on offer. The price at that time came to USD 5.1-5.16 per unit.
But international oil rates have slumped as demand evaporated due to outbreak of coronavirus and lockdowns imposed by countries around the globe. Essar Steel had picked up 2.25 mmscmd in the country’s first transparent and dynamic forward auction that lasted about five-and-a-half-hours on November 15, 2019, sources said.
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group and Mahanagar Gas Ltd bought 0.3 mmscmd, sources said, adding GAIL, acting on behalf of fertiliser companies, bought 0.3 mmscmd of gas. Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had bought 0.35 mmscmd and 0.10 mmscmd went to Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC)/Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), sources said. In all, 15 customers across sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, city gas, glass and ceramic got gas in the tender, they added.
In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translated into a price between USD 5.1 per mmBtu and USD 5.16 per mmBtu at the then prevailing Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel. Initially, Reliance had set a floor quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.
To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price. Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 — the largest among the lot — were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February. Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.

After a weak Q1, we expected a recovery in petchem and retail, while refining was expected to be weak. Reported Q2 refining earnings were much weaker than our estimate. However, petchem, Jio and retail earnings were better than our expectations. Standalone Ebitda (+8% q-o-q, -44% y-o-y) and consolidated Ebitda (+12% q-o-q, but -16% y-o-y) were ~3% ahead of our estimates.
Consolidated adjusted PBT (+28% q-o-q, -30% y-o-y) was 10% below our estimate, as the decline/increase in interest cost/other income after the recent stake sale were lower than our estimates. However, consolidated adjusted PAT of Rs 95.6 bn (+16% q-o-q, -15% y-o-y) was 10% ahead of our estimate due to a very low effective tax rate.

Refining very weak with 10-year low GRM; petchem recovery much better: Reported GRM of $5.7/bbl (vs $6.3 in Q1) was the lowest in over a decade. Also, throughput at 15.3mmt (-8% q-o-q) was lower due to shut-down. Refining Ebit of Rs 17.5 bn (-36% q-o-q,-66% y-o-y) was lowest in nearly eight years. Compared with the two-decade low of -0.9/bbl in Q1, SG complex margins at $0.05/bbl recovered marginally, but were still very low. Margins are weak in Q3 so far and near term outlook is weak.
Petchem saw much stronger recovery, with Ebit of Rs 48.4 bn up 45% q-o-q. Reliance benefited from a strong revival in domestic demand, leading to a much higher placement of products in the domestic market. Also, margins were stronger for PVC, PE and ethane cracking.
Jio did marginally better than our expectation: Standalone revenue at Rs 175 bn (+6% q-o-q, +33% y-o-y) was 2% ahead of our estimate, driven by a 3% q-o-q improvement in ARPU to Rs 145 and 2% q-o-q growth in the wireless subscriber base to 404 mn. Ebitda at Rs 75 bn (+7% q-o-q, +46% y-o-y) was 2% ahead of our estimate.
With continued market share gains, ramp-up of FTTH/enterprise services, tie-ups with strategic investors, in-house 5G capabilities and roll-out of digital ecosystem, we believe the outlook remains strong.
Retail saw better than expected recovery: Compared with just 50% stores in Q1, nearly 85% stores were operational in Q2. Footfalls are steadily recovering (reached 85% of pre-COVID-19 levels in September), but levels remain low for fashion and lifestyle. Revenue at Rs 392 bn (+24% q-o-q) was down just 5% y-o-y, and should reach pre-COVID-19 levels soon. Ebitda at Rs 19.9 bn (+83% q-o-q, -15% y-o-y) was 18% above our estimate.
However, consolidated adjusted PAT of Rs 95.6 bn (+16% q-o-q, -15% y-o-y) was 10% ahead of our estimate due to a very low effective tax rate.
Net debt reduces sharply: With funds inflow of Rs 1,467 bn ($20 bn) from transactions in H1, RIL’s net debt fell to Rs 935 bn as at end-Sep, and also other financial liabilities like capex creditors have declined sharply. With further inflow of `302 bn for Retail transactions in Q3, and balance commitments of Rs 736 bn (for Jio and Rights issue), RIL is effectively debt free.
Valuation: We use an SOTP methodology to value RIL’s different businesses. For refining/ petchem, we use 7x/8x average of FY22-23F EV/Ebitda. We use DCF to value the E&P business. We value R-Jio at 11x average FY22-23F EV/Ebitda and Reliance Retail at 27x average FY22-23F blended EV/Ebitda. Our TP is Rs 2,450. The benchmark index for this stock is Nifty 50.

""Strong performance in digital services, and earnings recovery in the petrochemical and retail segments underpinned the improvement in consolidated earnings, a credit positive,"" Moody's said in a note.
Stating that the firm's earnings are expected to gradually recover to pre-pandemic levels, the rating agency said RIL's credit metrics will remain strongly positioned for its Baa2 rating because of its zero net debt status on a reported basis.
The digital services segment, which includes India's youngest but largest telecom operator Jio, reported an 8.7 per cent EBITDA growth during the second quarter of FY2021, taking its quarterly EBITDA to more than USD 1 billion, while its subscribers now number more than 40 crore.
""We expect earnings within digital services to grow over the next 12-18 months on the back of further improvement in profitability and a ramp up of other services within the segment, such as home and enterprise broadband services,"" it said.
Reliance's refining segment had a 21.4 per cent decline in reported EBITDA in the quarter compared with the preceding quarter. ""The drop in earnings was due to lower refining margins and reduced capacity utilisation because of refinery maintenance.""

""We expect refining margins to remain weak at or near current levels for the next six to 12 months because of weak product demand and already high inventory levels,"" Moody's said. ""However, we expect refining throughput to improve as economic activity gathers pace.""

Nonetheless, as the number of coronavirus infections grow in India, a second wave of lockdowns cannot be ruled out, it said. ""This poses a risk to our expectations on further recovery in throughput levels.""

Moody's expected earnings from the refining segment to improve from current levels, but full-year earnings for fiscal 2021 will still be 17-18 per cent lower compared with fiscal 2020.
The firm's petrochemical segment reported a 34.6 per cent EBITDA growth during the second quarter of FY2021 compared with the preceding quarter.
""The earnings improvement during the quarter was underpinned by higher volumes supported by a favourable product mix. At the same time, product spreads improved during the quarter although they were lower compared with prior years,"" the rating agency said expecting petrochemicals production volumes to continue to improve, underpinned by strong domestic demand.
Earnings within the retail segment almost doubled during the second quarter of FY2021 compared with the previous quarter on the back of the reopening of retail stores and increase in shopper footfalls following gradual easing of lockdowns.
""We expect the shopper traffic and sales to gather further momentum in third quarter of fiscal 2021 because of India's upcoming festive season and improving consumer sentiment,"" it said.
Earnings within the segment will also be supported by new store openings following easing of lockdowns.
However, similar to the refining segment, the possibility of a second wave of lockdowns poses a risk to earnings growth within the segment, it said.
RIL, Moody's said, has already reduced its net debt to zero following announced stake sales in its retail and digital services segments, as well as a rights issue offering.
Of the USD 33.4 billion of fund raising initiatives announced since April 2020, the company has already received around USD 23.6 billion while another USD 9.8 billion is expected to be received over the next few quarters.
Additionally, the company's capital spending will decrease from historical levels as the bulk of the spending in the digital services is now complete.
""As such, we expect that the company's existing cash and internal cash flow generation of around USD 8 billion-USD 9 billion will be sufficient to meet its future spending needs,"" the agency said.
Meanwhile, proceeds from any further asset monetisation will accumulate on the balance sheet, thereby strengthening its capital structure and enhancing its financial flexibility, it said.
Consequently, credit metrics will remain strongly positioned for its current Baa2 rating over the next 12-18 months, Moody's added.

RIL shares ended the intraday trade today at Rs 1,876, down 178.50 points, or 8.69 per cent compared to previous close. Due to steep fall in RIL stock today, the investors' wealth saw a decline of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore as the total market cap of RIL including partly-paid shares, came down to Rs 13,40,603.5 crore.
""We forecast RIL's FY22 EPS to grow 20% to Rs 73/sh (net income ~Rs495 billion). That said, this is 23% below consensus explained by our view of a slower recovery in Reliance's refining and chemical margins, slower pace of ARPU hikes, lower retail margins as JioMart scales up, high competition in retail, higher working capital for retail, higher capex for JIO and retail, and higher minority interests. Similarly, our FY23 EPS is 18% below,"" it added.
Meanwhile, Mukesh Ambani led oil-to-telecom behemoth reported a 15 per cent drop in second quarter net profit after a slump in core oil and chemicals business dragged down continued good showing in consumer-facing verticals such as telecom.

Future Retail says Amazon dispute order not binding on company,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-bytes/future-retail-says-amazon-dispute-order-not-binding-on-company/articleshow/78992024.cms,"Last Updated: Nov 02, 2020, 09:51 AM IST","India's Future Retail NSE -9.98 % Ltd (FRL) said on Sunday that a Singapore arbitrator's order in its dispute with Amazon.com Inc is not enforceable under Indian law and not binding on the company.

Amazon on Oct. 25 won an injunction from the arbitrator to halt FRL's deal to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 % for $3.4 billion, arguing the Indian retail group had violated certain pre-existing agreements it had with the U.S. e-commerce giant.

Both FRL and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance said in news releases later they wanted to press on with the deal without delays, setting the stage for a showdown between the Indian companies and Jeff Bezos-led Amazon.

Calling the proceedings before the so-called ""emergency arbitrator"" void, FRL told Indian exchanges that any attempt on the part of Amazon to enforce the order will be resisted.

""FRL is also in the process of taking appropriate legal action to protect its rights,"" the company's regulatory filing said on Sunday.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FRL's filing comes after Reuters on Saturday reported Amazon had separately complained to India's markets regulator alleging the Indian company had misled shareholders by incorrectly saying it was complying with its contractual obligations, seeking suspension of the deal's regulatory review.

In its Sunday filing, FRL said it had complied with all regulatory requirements and urged the market regulator and the Indian stock exchanges to continue to review its deal with Reliance for approval.

The dispute centres around FRL's decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.

Amazon argues that a separate 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn't sell its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including any firms from Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani's group.

The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under Singapore International Arbitration Centre rules."
Reliance Industries Reports Robust Quarterly Numbers - Jio And Retail Going Strong - Investing.com India,Investing.com,https://in.investing.com/analysis/reliance-industries-reports-robust-quarterly-numbers--jio-and-retail-going-strong-200447113,"Stock Market Analysis
2020-11-02 04:03","Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) announced its quarterly results on October 30, reporting a consolidated bottom-line increase of 28 percent characterized by higher revenue, higher EBITDA, and lower interest charges over the previous quarter.

With strong quarterly figures, the business operations are seen to be approaching the pre-Covid levels for most operating segments. As per the chairman Mukesh Ambani, retail buying has returned to normalcy for key consumer products with the easing of lockdowns. The company has witnessed a sharp recovery across its Order-to-Cash (O2C) business processes.

The shape of consolidated quarterly numbers

Higher revenue over the previous quarter was on the account of favorable oil prices and retail business rebound. Retail stores experienced more footfalls with the lockdowns easing but the retail operations are still eyeing the impulsive customer purchases to push the retail numbers over pre-Covid levels.

Retail and digital services contributed 85 percent of the incremental consolidated EBITDA for the quarter. The weak oil refining numbers were offset by an improved performance by the petrochemical segment. Petrochemicals and oil products demand materialized into a 34.6 percent increase in the EBITDA for the segment. The company achieved record quarterly EBITDA for the digital services arm.

The decrease in finance costs was supported by fulfilling the higher cost obligations in advance. The acquisition of Reliance Holdings USA (RHUSA) partially increased finance costs. While the outstanding debt for the quarter ending was Rs 279,251 crores, funds raised and receivables stood in excess of outstanding debt. The enterprise value of the firm appreciated significantly with a massive inflow of capital in the form of equity investments and strategic partnerships.

How did the individual segments perform?

Reliance Jio – Digital Services

Reliance Jio revenue (7.2 percent QoQ) and EBITDA (8.7 percent QoQ) increased sequentially over the previous quarter with a slight increase in EBITDA margin. However, the segment reported a 19.8 percent net profit for the quarter under review.

With a customer base of 405 million subscribers, Reliance Jio became the only operator outside China to cross the 400 million subscriber mark by catering to a single country market. While the wireless line of operations witnessed a strong increase in the subscriber base, the monthly churn rate stood increased due to the impact of the pandemic on recharge cycles.

The more exciting development took place in the 5G space as Jio in collaboration with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) achieved a speed of over 1gbps using Reliance 5G solutions. Jio Platforms continued its development on building 5G infrastructure.

JioUPI completed its pan-India rollout with full integration with the BHIM UPI application.

Reliance Retail

Reliance Retail showed a phenomenal increase of 85 percent in the EBITDA for the quarter over the previous one. Revenue of the segment was the same as compared to last year despite stores working at a partial capacity. The increase in revenue implies a rebound in retail buying. Higher EBITDA growth stems from a low base factor, but the EBITDA margin also recovered from 3.8 previous quarter to 5.5 percent for the current quarter implying prompt cost management.

The retail figures point to a V-shaped recovery as the segment will be testing the pre-Covid level of operations.

The grocery line witnessed strong momentum with recovery in electronics and clothing lines as well. The company entered the pharma retail market and continued expanding its digital capabilities across consumption products. With consumer electronics posting twice the revenue than that of the previous quarter, the electronics growth is expected to continue through the third quarter with festive buying in effect.

Reliance Retail also ramped up its digital platforms to support online-buying and sustain competition. JioMart was able to leverage the strong demand for groceries driven by demand for staples and processed food during the lockdown.

Reliance – Petrochem, Refining and Marketing, Oil and Gas Exploration and Media

Petrochemicals segment delivered a strong performance on the back of a recovery in operating levels with some of the company’s crackers working at 100 percent utilization. The growth was driven by improvement in demand, which was led by restricted supply during the lockdown period. Segment revenue for the quarter was Rs 29,665 crores, which is 17.8 percent higher than the previous quarter. The revenue was mainly boosted by an increase in prices across the product line. The EBITDA margin of 20.1 percent was supported by efficient cracker mechanics and increasing PVC margins.

The company achieved the highest quarterly polymer domestic sales and polyester sales also picked up with the easing of lockdown. The revival of the auto, agriculture, and construction sectors is to drive further growth of the petrochemical segment.

The refining and marketing segment reported strong revenue growth (up 33 percent QoQ) supported increasing in the global oil demand and prices in the second quarter. However, the higher revenue numbers were offset by weak segment EBITDA which declined by 21.4 percent over the previous quarter. The company cited the higher cost of crude oil and lower-middle distillate cracks as the reason for the decline in the segment EBITDA.

The oil and gas exploration segment experienced a decline in production and favorable price realization that led to a revenue decline of 29.8 percent QoQ for the segment.

The media segment reported a revenue of Rs 1,061 crores (31.5 percent QoQ) and an EBITDA of Rs 166 crores (514.8 percent QoQ). Revenues from advertising and improved margins for broadcasting proved to be the growth factors of the segment. The segment continued to experience healthy subscription numbers that ultimately converted into increased television viewership. MoneyControl and Voot reported growth in subscribers for paid content.

Capital Financing and Strategic Partnerships

Reliance Industries facilitated the largest fundraising in India during the lockdown period and continued to attract capital from all over the globe. The capital was financed by a rights issue of Reliance shares and asset monetization. The funds received combined with receivables have taken the net debt levels to below zero.

Jio Platforms received investment from behemoths such as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, Silver Lake, and Qualcomm Ventures.
Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) secured investments from Silver Lake, General Atlantic, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, and GIC.
The regulatory authorities are deliberating over the potential acquisition of the Future Group’s retail and wholesale business by Reliance Retail
RRVL acquired a controlling stake in Netmeds
The overall quarterly results of RIL signal a sharp recovery in just six months after the pandemic made itself known. With the economy opening up and consumer spending returning to normalcy, the company stands to capitalize on demand revival. More importantly, the company showcased a robust balance sheet with the ability to sustain uncertainty in the near future.

Stock Market News
2020-11-02 06:09","By Aditya Raghunath
Investing.com -- The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact in the Americas and Europe as the number of cases has started rising up again. The COVID-19 cases in Europe have crossed the 10 million mark and countries like the UK, France, and Spain have once again imposed total or partial lockdowns. The U.S. is seeing a record surge in cases that is killing up to 1,000 people a day.
This new spike in cases has led to a massive drop in oil prices. Crude Oil WTI Futures that was trading at $40 in October is now below $35 levels. Brent Crude is between $36-$37 levels.
The drop in oil has affected markets in India with the Nifty trading at 11,616, down 0.23%, and the BSE trading at 39,555, down 0.14% at 11:10 AM.
Reliance (NS: RELI ) Industries fell over 5% as it reported a 15% fall in quarterly profit on Friday, October 30. Even though the number was higher than analyst estimates, the share is trading lower because of the drop in oil prices.
RIL accounts for almost 13.24% of the Nifty 50 and over 16% in the BSE Sensex . Any movement in its price affects both indices. Indian Oil (NS: IOC ) Corporation was also trading down 0.82% at the time of this report."
Only RIL deal can pull Future Retail out of crisis: Future tells bourses,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/only-ril-deal-can-pull-future-retail-out-of-crisis-future-tells-bourses,": Sunday, November 1, 2020, 11:40 PM IST","Urging the BSE and NSE to go ahead with the processing of the application of Future Retail's proposed buyout by Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), Future Retail has told the exchanges that it is in deep financial trouble and the deal with Reliance Industries-led RRVL is the only rescue route for the debt-laden company.
In a regulatory filing, Future Retail Ltd (FRL) urged the exchanges not to take cognizance of Amazon's recent letter to them and the Singapore-based arbitration court's interim order.
Just a week ago, an emergency arbitrator in Singapore directed a temporary stay on the proposed acquisition of Future Retail's assets by Reliance Retail.
""FRL is undergoing serious financial difficulties, particularly in light of the unprecedented impact of the Covid pandemic; the proposed scheme is the only way, it can come out of the situation,"" it said.
It also said that FRL has complied with all the requirements of obtaining the requisite approval from Future Coupons Private Ltd, as was required in the Shareholders Agreement executed by FRL with its promoters.
The company further said that the scheme is in the best interest of all stakeholders, that includes shareholders, financial institutions, vendors and suppliers, and more importantly employees, among others and any delay in its implementation will cause irreparable losses to all stakeholders.
Future Retail further said that the arbitrator's order does not restrict market regulator SEBI or the exchanges from considering the scheme and approving the scheme.
It said that the arbitrator's order accepted Amazon's contention that two separate shareholder agreements, one between Amazon and FRL's promoters (to which FRL is not a party) and another between FRL and its promoter (to which Amazon is not a party) constitute one single integrated transaction and that by such a composite transaction, Amazon has an interest in and rights against FRL.
""This contention raised by Amazon is entirely misconceived,"" it said.
Future said that, at best, Amazon's claims are a contractual dispute between Amazon and the promoters of FRL, and Amazon has already initiated arbitration for the same.
It said that SEBI and the stock exchanges should consider the scheme independently on its merits, and as per SEBI regulations.
According to the company, a contractual dispute between the promoters of FRL and Amazon cannot restrict or interfere with the authority of the SEBI and the stock exchanges to approve the scheme involving the listed entity. The emergency arbitrator's order cannot and does not in any manner restrict the SEBI or the stock exchanges from considering and approving the scheme.
""FRL therefore respectfully prays that BSE and NSE should continue to process our application for issuance of observation letter/no-objection letter permitting the captioned Scheme to be filed before the NCLT,"" it said.
On Amazon's contention of integrated agreement, Future Retail said that if the two separate agreements were treated as a single integrated transaction by which Amazon obtained an interest in and rights against FRL, then in 2019, when the agreements were executed, there would have been a change in control of FRL in favour of Amazon, requiring it to make an open offer to FRL's public shareholders in terms of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011.
""No such open offer was made, thereby suggesting that there was no intent of Amazon to consider the two agreements as a single integrated transaction at that point of time,"" it said.
It noted that given that the order is premised on violation of SEBI Regulations, it cannot and ought not to be accorded any sanctity by the SEBI, the NSE and the BSE."

Amazon tells SEBI Future Retail is misleading shareholders,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/amazon-tells-sebi-future-retail-is-misleading-shareholders/story/420532.html,"Reuters | October 31, 2020 | Updated 22:07 IST","Amazon.com Inc has complained to India's market regulator that its local partner Future Retail Ltd misled shareholders by incorrectly saying it was complying with its contractual obligations to the U.S. e-commerce giant, a letter seen by Reuters shows.
Amazon is locked in a bitter legal dispute with Future Group, which in August sold its retail assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd for $3.4 billion. The deal, Amazon alleges, breaches 2019 agreements by Future.
The tussle has strained Amazon's ties not just with Future Retail - one of India's top retailers - but also with Ambani, Asia's richest man, and his Reliance group, which is fast expanding its e-commerce business and threatening companies like Amazon.
Amazon last Sunday won an injunction to halt Future's deal with Reliance from a Singapore arbitrator both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes. The Indian retailer then said in a news release it had complied with all agreements and ""cannot be held back"" by the arbitration proceedings.
In the letter to the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairman Ajay Tyagi on Wednesday, Amazon said Future's news release and stock exchange disclosures violated Indian regulations, urging the regulator to investigate the matter and not approve the deal.
""Such a disclosure is against public interest, misleads public shareholders ... as well as perpetuates a fraud for the benefit of the Biyanis alone,"" Amazon letter said, referring to Future's promoter family led by Kishore Biyani.
A spokesman for Future Group and the Biyani family declined to comment. A Future group source denied Amazon's allegations, saying there was no question of any fraud or misleading the public or shareholders, without elaborating.
Amazon declined to comment on its letter, the contents of which have not previously been reported. Reliance and SEBI did not respond to requests for comment.
""IRREPARABLE HARM""
Amazon says the 2019 deal, in which it invested nearly $200 million in a Future unit, had clauses saying the Indian group could not sell its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list, which included Reliance.
Reliance, which in August bought Future's retail, wholesale and some other businesses, has said it plans to ""enforce its rights and complete the (Future) transaction ... without any delay.""
The faceoff comes as Jeff Bezos-led Amazon has already been battling tighter foreign investment rules and antitrust cases in India, which is one of its key growth markets where it has committed investments of $6.5 billion.
Some Indian lawyers have argued the Singapore arbitrator's order in favour of Amazon is not automatically enforceable and would need ratification by an Indian court. But Amazon believes the order is binding, it told SEBI. The letter asks the regulator to ""suspend review"" of the deal.
SEBI's action in the matter ""would promote ease of doing business in India by holding listed companies accountable for their dealings,"" Amazon's letter says.
Amazon says the Future-Reliance deal means the U.S. giant will lose the prospect of becoming the single largest shareholder of the Indian retailer, which has an ""irreplaceable and widespread network"" of more than 1,500 retail stores.
Future has argued it entered into the deal with Reliance because its retail business was severely hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.
The arbitrator, V K Rajah, a former attorney general of Singapore, sided with Amazon in his Oct. 25 order, saying: ""The law expects businesspersons to honour their contractual commitments.""
The U.S. company told SEBI that if the Future-Reliance deal ""is implemented by completely disregarding the interim (arbitration) award, it will cause irreparable harm and injury to Amazon.""

Reliance Retail:
On a consolidated basis, revenue from operations for Q2 FY21 increased by 29.7% QoQ to Rs 36,566 crore, and at the same level as the last year despite restricted store operations and lower footfalls. The retail arm's net profit for Q2 September 2020 was at Rs 973 crore, higher by 125.8% QoQ.
EBITDA for Q2 FY21 increased by 85.9% QoQ to Rs 2,006 crore. EBITDA margin (on revenue from operations) recovered by 170 bps to 5.5% in Q2 FY21 against 3.8% in Q1 FY21.

O2C-Petrochemicals:
Segment revenue increased by 17.8% quarter on quarter (QoQ) to Rs 29,665 crore with higher prices across product portfolio and higher volumes. Segment EBITDA for Q2 FY21 increased by 34.6% Q-o-Q to Rs 5,964 crore primarily on account of higher production volume and higher volume placement in domestic market. EBITDA margins also improved sequentially by 250 bps with firm cracker margins, effective product and sales mix and superior ethane cracking economics.
O2C Refining & Marketing:
Segment revenue for Q2 FY21 increased by 33.3% quarter on quarter basis to Rs 62,154 crore primarily due to higher crude oil price.

Segment EBITDA for Q2 September 2020 declined by 21.4% QoQ to Rs 3,002 crore primarily on account of lower middle distillates cracks and narrower light-heavy crude differential leading to higher crude cost. The performance was also partially affected by planned turnaround during the quarter.
Oil And Gas (Exploration & Production) Business:
Segment Revenues for Q2 FY21 declined by 29.8% QoQ to Rs 355 crore primarily due to lower price realisation and decline in production. The segment witnessed an EBITDA loss of Rs 194 crore against a loss of Rs 32 crore in the preceding quarter.
Media Business:

"Reliance Industries Ltd’s Q2 result gets a fillip from Jio, retail arm",Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/reliance-industries-ltd-s-q2-result-gets-a-fillip-from-jio-retail-arm/story-IaYpAECSAc8ZkSIUmhirSM.html,"PUBLISHED ON OCT 31, 2020 06:07 AM IST","Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday posted a profit of Rs9,567 crore for the fiscal second-quarter ended September, beating analysts’ estimates. While profit declined by 15% from a year earlier because of lower revenues from its oil and gas business, it was still higher than the Rs9,017.10 crore estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
The decline in oil and gas revenue was, however, cushioned by strong revenue growth in the company’s telecom and retail arms housed under Jio Platforms Ltd and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. The Mumbai-based company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs11,262 crore in the year-earlier quarter.
Reliance’s retail arm reported revenue of Rs41,100 crore in the September quarter, little changed from a year earlier, but a substantial improvement from the Rs31,620 crore it posted in the preceding June quarter as lockdown conditions eased across the country and physical stores resumed business. Operating revenue (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) was Rs2,006 crore in the quarter, compared to Rs2,322 crore in the year-ago period, while the Ebitda margin narrowed to 5.4% versus 6.3% last year.
“Retail business activity has normalized with strong growth in key consumption baskets as lockdowns ease across the country,” chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a statement.
“With large capital raise in the last six months across Jio and retail business, we have welcomed several strategic and financial investors into the Reliance family,” he added.
“Increased footfall and store openings have contributed to the rebound in retail revenues, with 85% of stores now open,” V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer of RIL, said in an online press conference.
Reliance said it expects retail activity to return to pre-pandemic levels in the ongoing quarter. The company said retail revenue growth was led by strong performance in the consumer electronics segment, thanks to strong demand across categories, with laptops and productivity devices more than doubling sales and high-end TVs, air care and appliances delivering strong growth. The performance was aided by event activation during the Independence Day Golden Event, enabled by offers, strong value proposition and affordability schemes, the company said.
Reliance Jio Infocomm reported a net profit of Rs2,844 crore for the September quarter, nearly tripling the Rs990 crore posted in the same quarter last fiscal. The telecom subsidiary’s revenue from operations rose to Rs17,481 crore from Rs13,130 crore in the same period last year. The average revenue per user (Arpu) rose to Rs145 from Rs140 in the June quarter, and Rs120 a year ago, buoyed by work-from-home that drove data consumption higher, making Jio the “first operator outside China to have 400 million subscribers in a single-country market”.
In the mainstay oil and gas businesses, the company witnessed considerable improvement in operating performance due to improved market conditions as revenue and Ebitda in the petrochemical segment rose sequentially by 17.8% quarter-on-quarter with higher prices across its product portfolio and higher volumes, but are still 23% lower than ₹38,538 crore a year ago.
In the refining and marketing segment, revenue increased by 33.3% to Rs62,154 crore, but was 36% lower than Rs97,229 crore a year ago.

Reliance Industries Posts 15% Profit Drop as Pandemic Hits Oil Demand,Bloomberg Quint,https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/reliance-posts-15-fall-in-profit-as-pandemic-hurts-fuel-demand,"Oct 30 2020, 8:07 PM","(Bloomberg) --
Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s most valuable company led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, reported a 15% decline in profit for the quarter through September, as the coronavirus pandemic gutted demand for transportation fuels.
Net income fell to 95.7 billion rupees ($1.28 billion) from 112.6 billion rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in an exchange filing Friday. That compares with the average 90.17 billion-rupee profit estimated by analysts.
Revenue at the refining-to-retail conglomerate fell 24% to 1.16 trillion rupees.
Key Insights
Reliance is among oil refining giants slammed by a plunge in demand for transportation and aviation fuels as the raging pandemic stifled demand, forced people to stay home and pushed many economies into recession.
Reliance is in the midst of a transformation led by Ambani, 63, as he looks to mold the oil-and-petrochemicals giant into a technology titan by boosting its telecom and e-commerce businesses.
The earnings also underscore the growing need for the conglomerate to pare its dependence on the energy sector and pivot to consumer businesses that aim to tap India’s population of more than a billion.
Ambani’s bet on digital and retail services in India has won investments of more than $25 billion from investors including Google and Facebook Inc. this year despite the pandemic. Reliance also raised $7 billion through a rights issue.
As a result of the fundraising, Reliance said it became a zero-net-debt firm in June, months ahead of its March 2021 target. Investors are still awaiting the proposed stake sale in Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. -- a deal that Ambani said in July was delayed.
Market Reaction
Ambani’s deals frenzy fueled a 31% rally in Reliance’s shares in the quarter ended September, bringing the year’s gains to 37%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has lost 4% this year. Earnings were announced after trading hours.

Reliance Industries Q2 net falls 15 pc on weak oil business,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/reliance-industries-q2-net-falls-15-pc-on-weak-oil-business,": Friday, October 30, 2020, 10:14 PM IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday reported a 15 per cent drop in second quarter net profit after the pandemic-hit oil demand dragged down continued good showing in consumer-facing businesses such as telecom.
Consolidated net profit attributable to owners at Rs 9,567 crore in July-September compared with Rs 11,262 crore a year back, Reliance said in a stock exchange filing.
A plunge in fuel demand after the raging pandemic forced people to stay home and stifled the economy dealt a body blow to the firm's traditional cash cow oil refining and petrochemicals, even as consumer-facing businesses, which account for 35 per cent of the oil-to-telecom-to-retail conglomerate's revenues, continued to do well.

Its digital services, which includes the telecom arm Jio, saw standalone net profit swell to Rs 2,844 crore in the second quarter of current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021) from Rs 990 crore a year back.
This after the four-year-old Jio's subscriber base grew to 406 million, the largest in India.
Net addition of 7.3 million subscribers and per-user revenue rising to Rs 145 helped the telecom business soar.
The gradually 'unlock' that has seen markets and malls reopen helped the company's retail business recover with almost flat revenue and a 14 per cent lower EBITDA of Rs 2,009 crore.
Reliance said 85 per cent of its retail stores were open as of second quarter. It added 232 stores to take the total to 11,931 stores.
Ambani raised an unprecedented Rs 2.5 lakh crore since April from sale of stake in the digital and retail units and a rights issue. Of this, over Rs 1.76 lakh crore has already flowed into the company, helping it achieve net zero debt status.
Petrochemicals revenue fell 23 per cent to Rs 29,665 crore and pre-tax profit dropped 33 per cent at Rs 5,964 crore.
Refining EBITA almost halved to Rs 3,002 crore as revenue slumped 36 per cent.
The firm's twin refineries earned USD 5.7 per barrel on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, as compared to a gross refining margin (GRM) of USD 9.4 per barrel last year.
The profit in Q2 was lower sequentially as well as the April-June earning of Rs 13,248 crore included one-time gain of Rs 7,629 crore from sale of 49 per cent stake in petro retailing business to BP.
Investors such as Facebook, Google and global private equity funds have picked up a cumulative 32.96 per cent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 1.52 lakh crore. All the deals, except Google, have been completed, bringing Rs 1.18 lakh crore into the company.
Another Rs 37,710 crore was raised from the sale of an 8.48 per cent stake in its retail unit. Of this, Rs 7,500 crore has come in and the rest Rs 30,210 crore is pending.

RIL is scheduled to announce its earnings for the July-September quarter of FY21 later today.
The two sovereign wealth funds are expected to invest nearly $512 million each to take over a total 51 per cent in the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) - Digital Fibre Infrastructure Trust (DFIT) - formed by RIL, The Economic Times reported citing unidentified sources. The funds have already invested $2.2 billion in Jio. Law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co advised PIF on the investment.
As of March 31, 2020, Jio Digital Fibre operates optic fibre cable network of nearly 17.37 million fibre pairs per kilometre (FPKM) across the country.
Ambani had recently said that in order to further extend the company's global leadership in connectivity, Jio is now rolling out a high-speed, low-latency optical fibre network to more than 50 million homes and premises. Also, Jio is preparing for rolling out 5G services across India. Ambani said Jio Platforms has built significant capabilities in areas like cloud computing, big data analytics, AI and machine learning, blockchain, AR or VR and IoT.
Meanwhile, RIL may report up to 34 per cent year-on-year drop in September quarter, according to market analysts.  On a QoQ basis, the company may log recovery even though the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still visible.  Reliance's take on the recent legal battle between Amazon India and Future Group will also be watched keenly by market analysts."

While the sales have picked up sharply from the COVID lows in the Jun-20 quarter, the sales value normally gets depressed when the crude prices fall. On a yoy basis, the Brent prices are almost 40% lower on an average.


The operating profits for the quarter ended Sep-20 was 28.8% lower on a yoy basis at Rs12,319cr. The net profits for the Sep-20 quarter lower by just about 6.6% at Rs10,602cr. RIL has managed to hold its bottom line above the Rs10,000cr mark through the COVID period even as digital and retail are playing a larger role in the top line.


This had an overall impact on the margins of Reliance Industries. For the Sep-20 quarter, the operating profit margins or OPM was down 68 bps at 10.60%. However, the net profit margins or NPM for the quarter improved by 172 bps at 9.12%. This improvement was largely on the back of achieving profits at lower revenue base.


RIL top line numbers have been subject to the changes in crude oil prices as it impacts the refining margins as well as the inventory translation.

OPM 10.60% 11.28% 11.58%
Net Margins 9.12% 7.40% 14.52%
 



Key takeaways from the Sep-20 quarter results

For the Sep-20 quarter, the biggest contributor to overall revenues continues to be oil refining. Out of the four major pockets of business that RIL now focuses on, the contribution to revenues was as under. Oil refining accounted for the bulk of 38% of the total revenues for the quarter following by retail segment generating 24% of the total revenues. In addition, petchem generated 18% while digital generated 14%. These four segments collectively accounted for 94% of total revenues.
The picture gets a lot more interesting when you look at the EBITDA contributions. Out of the total EBITDA figure of Rs20,885cr, Digital accounted for 40% following by petchem at 29%. Refining contributed just about 14% of EBITDA while retail contributed another 10%. Clearly, digital is making its presence felt in the EBITDA game in the quarter.
In the latest quarter debt equity ratio fell sharply from 0.72 last year to 0.46 in Sep-20 after Reliance prepaid long term debt to the tune of Rs54,198cr during the latest quarter. That is the reason why the sharp fall of the debt service coverage to 0.23 looks a tad out of place. This should stabilize in the coming quarters. It is one more step towards their zero-debt target by Mar-21."

Amazon on October 25 won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt Future's deal to sell retail assets to Reliance, arguing the Indian retailer group breached certain contract provisions it entered into last year in a separate deal with the US firm.
Both Indian firms reacted to the decision by saying they want to complete the deal “without any delay”. Amazon has now written to SEBI, as well as the BSE and the NSE, to put the deal on hold in light of the arbitration order, two separate sources said.
A BSE source said it will consult SEBI about its stance on the deal and the exchange later on Friday also plans to seek clarification from Future and Reliance Retail.
 SEBI and the stock exchanges did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined comment, while Future and Reliance did not immediately respond.
The dispute centres around Future's decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.
Restricted list
Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn't sell its retail assets to anyone on a “restricted persons” list including any firms from Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani's group.
Amazon has shared a copy of the Singapore arbitrator's interim order with SEBI and the two stock exchanges, hoping they would step in to stall the approval, the second source said.
People familiar with the case have previously told Reuters the Singapore arbitrator's order is not automatically enforceable in India and Amazon may need to get a binding order from an Indian court."

Reliance Industries Ltd.’s profit and revenue are expected to decline as demand for petchem fuel remained under pressure and refining margin continued to fall in the quarter ended September.
Consolidated net profit of India’s biggest company by market capitalisation is expected to fall 27.2% year-on-year to Rs 8,194 crore in the July-September period, according to the average of analyst estimates tracked by Bloomberg. Consolidated revenue is likely to fall by a fourth to Rs 1,11,468 crore, while operating income is estimated to slip 13.7%.
But the performance of its telecom unit and a rebound in the retail segment are expected to aid the parent’s financials sequentially.
Reliance Industries is set to announce its second-quarter results on Friday.
Global fuel demand fell sharply after countries imposed lockdowns to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Lower demand for refined products led to a decline in output by refineries. In India, too, demand for petrol and diesel fell in April and most of May, hurting refining margin. While domestic demand improved as the nation gradually lifted the shutdown, margin remained under pressure.
The Singapore gross refining margin—the Asian benchmark for what a refiner earns on processing every barrel of crude—settled at near-zero per barrel during the quarter ended September compared with minus $0.9 in the preceding three months.
Brent crude price, too, ended flat in the second quarter after rising 36% sequentially to $42.7 a barrel.
Refining utilisation is expected to decline as it shut crude refining units for maintenance, leading to lower throughput (15 million tonnes). An improvement in gasoline and naphtha cracks is likely to be offset by a decline in diesel-LPG cracks, supplemented by a rise in crude selling price during the quarter.
While petrochemical volume may improve sequentially for most chemical products as demand rose after India eased lockdown curbs, a complete recovery may take time.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. added 12 million subscribers in the quarter ended September, taking its total user base to 410 million. The telecom unit’s revenue is expected to rise sequentially, driven by user addition and delayed translation of tariff hikes. The company’s ARPU for the second quarter is seen at Rs 143.8.
Reliance Retail
The core retail revenue may jump quarter-on-quarter, driven by JioMart as people still buy grocery online despite easing lockdown curbs. Fashion and electronics, however, will continue to decline."

Clash of the titans — Amazon versus Reliance,The Hindu Businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/the-cheat-sheet/clash-of-the-titans-amazon-versus-reliance/article32965564.ece,"October 29, 2020","Unstoppable force seems to have met an immovable object at a Singapore tribunal last weekend.
You bet. It’s rather rare that Reliance Industries’ deals get derailed. But, then, Amazon is no pushover either. And, when the stakes are high, you can expect a tooth-and-nail fight. This clash of the titans, Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani, among the two richest persons of the world, has big implications.

Such as...
One, Future’s future is at stake. If its ₹24,713-crore deal announced in August to sell the chunk of its business to Reliance Retail does not go through, because of the legal challenge mounted by Amazon, the debt-laden Future Group may be staring at liquidation. Amazon’s alternative fund-raising options for Future may not be workable now — it’s just too much water under the bridge.
Next, Reliance Retail’s growth plans face a potential setback. Reliance Retail — already the country’s largest organised retailer with about 12,000 stores — was expecting a quick scale-up with the acquisition of the Future Group’s 1,800 or so stores. The acquisition would also have helped Reliance Industries’ plans to take on the entrenched Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce sweepstakes in India.
Besides, the many marquee investors who have put in thousands of crores for a stake in Reliance Retail the past few months might be uneasy over the recent turn of events. Their investments would have assumed that Future’s major businesses are in Reliance Retail’s kitty. So, it’s a big deal for Reliance.
Now, why is Amazon playing the spoilsport, or is it?
Well, think about the fracas from Amazon’s perspective. It had bought 49 per cent in Future Coupons in August last year for ₹1,430 crore; FDI rules did not allow it to invest in Future Retail. Future Coupons held 7.3 per cent in Future Retail and so Amazon indirectly held about 3.6 per cent in Future Retail.
The agreement also gave Amazon an option of acquiring all or part of the promoter’s shareholding in Future Retail between the third and tenth year. There were also some share-transfer restrictions on the promoter shares in the company and a right of first offer to Amazon. Besides, Amazon had drawn up a ‘negative list’ of entities to whom shares could not be sold; Reliance Industries was part of this list.
Amazon’s investment in Future Coupons would have been predicated on improving its presence in the brick-and-mortal retail space in India. Amazon is said to have been informally helping Future Retail find a suitable investor such as Premji Invest — before Kishore Biyani decided to hitch his wagon to Mukesh Ambani. Net-net, Amazon feels short-changed by the Future-Reliance deal, which it thinks will make its investment futile. So, it petitioned a Singapore arbitral tribunal, asking to stop the deal.
It’s got relief, it seems
Well, Amazon has won the first round. The emergency arbitrator has put an interim stay on the Future-Reliance deal. But the legal battle is far from over. Future Retail says it is not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings. It has questioned the Singapore court’s jurisdiction, and said that the order will have to be tested under the Indian Arbitration Act.
Both Future Retail and Reliance Retail have said that they propose to complete the transaction without delay. Amazon, meanwhile, could also be moving to have the stay enforced.
So, a grand legal battle beckons
Yes. Unless the warring parties smoke the peace pipe. The Future rides on hope.

Tata eyes majority stake in e-grocer BigBasket,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/tata-eyes-majority-stake-in-e-grocer-bigbasket/story-uSQ0aOv8czvUO0HmxniZIP.html,"PUBLISHED ON OCT 28, 2020 06:12 AM IST","The Tata group is in active discussions to take a controlling stake in BigBasket by buying out several existing investors of the online grocer, three people directly aware of the talks said.
If the talks are successful, Tata group could pay around $500-700 million in cash to a clutch of financial investors, mainly private equity funds and China’s Alibaba group, BigBasket’s largest investor, the people said, requesting anonymity
“The talks are currently hinged on the extent of say Tata group will have in the company post the deal,” said one of the three people.
 “While BigBasket’s existing investors are not averse to the idea of selling a controlling stake to Tata group, they also want the current management, led by the founders, to remain at the helm,” this person said. “Investors also want BigBasket to hit the IPO (initial public offering) market by the next calendar year, irrespective of Tata’s coming on board,” the above person added.
A Tata group spokesperson declined to comment.
The deal, if struck, will give Tata group an immediate head-start to take on the three big players in India’s thriving online grocery marketplace: Reliance Industries Ltd, Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.
For the Tata group, the deal is aimed at securing as much control as possible in India’s fast-growing e-commerce market before Reliance Industries Ltd and Flipkart become too big, said the second person.
Mint reported on October 14 that Tata group has joined the conversation to pick up a minority stake in Bengaluru-based BigBasket, which has been looking to raise $200 million in growth capital.
Along with Tata group, private equity funds Temasek and Generation Investment Management, too, were in discussions to invest in BigBasket.
BigBasket has seen strong tailwinds due to the Covid-19 pandemic, attesting industry estimates that grocery will be the biggest driver of online e-commerce, contributing 40% to gross merchandise volume between 2019 and 2024.
The online penetration of the grocery market is currently only at 0.5% and absolute size is $2 billion. But it is estimated to grow from $1.9 billion in 2019 to $3 billion by this year-end, according to a September RedSeer report.
BigBasket, which has the biggest market share in the online grocery space, saw new customers on its delivery platform increasing by 84% between January and July, while the retention rate of customers grew 50%.
In August, Financial Times reported that Tata group is preparing a new platform, aimed for a December or January launch that will put together the salt-to-steel conglomerate’s varied offerings on a single platform, christened a “super app” by the Tatas.
“The app would eventually encompass services from food and grocery ordering to fashion, lifestyle, electronics, insurance, financial services, education, healthcare and bill payments,” N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, told investors recently.
BigBasket is India’s largest online food and grocery firm with over 18,000 products and 1,000 brands.
The Bengaluru-based startup, which recently became a unicorn, has a market share of more than 50% in the online grocery market.
Its revenue grew a massive 70% to ₹3,200 crore in FY19. Although losses widened, it crossed an annualised gross sales run-rate of $1 billion for the first time in May.

Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd. will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.
""India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,"" he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions.

""Why is India important, because it is India,"" he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50% coal to 40%, while gas and renewables will grow.
Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.
As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand.
RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45.
RIL holds 51% in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49%. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49% stake.

This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.
BP had in 2011 bought a 30% stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India.
RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.
""Our production with Reliance will account for 15% of India gas production,"" he said.
Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.
GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that, Looney said.
When Goods and Services Tax , which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products - petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.

This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel.
He said BP has a ""deep, trusting relationship"" with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.
On the impact of Covid-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term.
But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.
Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30% of the world average, offering huge potential.
""We want to be an important part of India,"" he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country."

Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, Bernard Looney, Group chief executive of bp p.l.c. and Patrick Pouyanne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Total, emphasised on natural gas being a central aspect of their strategy for India’s energy transition.
According to Looney, natural gas production from joint venture projects with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is going to represent 15 per cent of India’s demand.

He said, “Our production is going to represent 15 per cent of India’s gas demand in the next several years. If you look at it from a production basis, it is going to be 20-25 per cent of India’s gas production. This is a part of three major projects we are bringing online with the first later this year.”
New retail sites
Looney also said that within their partnership with Reliance, the bp-Jio vertical will be setting up 5,500 new retail sites over the next four to five years. This will be up from the existing 1,500 retail outlets.
He said the Green Growth equity fund will be focus on growing renewable energy investment and added that a technology centre will be opened in Pune in the coming weeks.
On what can be done to make the natural gas business more lucrative in India, Looney said, “It is a complex market, it has 29 markets within itself (each state having different laws), and we think the Goods and Services Tax has been a welcome federal initiative to ease trade in India. And we believe it would make sense to incorporate gas within that.”
Looney also said that bp is in the process of evolving beyond an oil company, “bp has been an international oil company for 111 years, focussed on the production of resources. It is time for us to transition to an integrated energy company that’s focused on delivering solutions for customers.”
Speaking in a subsequent session, Total’s Pouyanne said, “In LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), the fundamental idea is to be able to replace in industries which today are using fuels to produce electricity. You have a lot of industries in India who are burning fuel at the oil price…LNG at $5-6 per million British thermal units can be competitive. Of course, it requires the development of networks.”
City gas networks
Lauding the Centre’s push to develop city gas networks and long-distance pipelines in the country, Pouyanne said that the Indian government has an active policy to develop these networks and bring gas to more and more industries. Pouyanne said, “The energy consumption per capita in India is just 30 per cent of the world average. So you have a huge potential with a very dynamic young population and that is a key priority of the Indian government….”"

"India begins anti-dumping probe into low density polyethylene imports from US, UAE, others",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/india-begins-anti-dumping-probe-into-low-density-polyethylene-imports-from-us-uae-others/articleshow/78889457.cms,"Last Updated: Oct 26, 2020, 06:35 PM IST","New Delhi: India has begun an anti-dumping investigation into the imports of low density polyethylene (LDPE) from the US, UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Thailand after the Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturers Association (CPMA) filed an application to initiate the anti-dumping investigation.

“Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), which is a domestic producer of the product, has provided its information as domestic industry… RIL is the sole producer of the product under consideration in India,” the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) said in a notification.

The investigation will cover imports between April 1, 2019-June 30, 2020.

LPDE is used for producing trash bags, frozen food packaging, lamination film, bubble wrap, adhesive tape backing films and foam for manufacture of mattresses, among others.

As per the notification, the association has claimed that due to the price effect of dumped imports, performance of the domestic industry has been adversely impacted leading to an increase in its inventories, decline in its profitability, and return on capital employed.

“There is sufficient prima facie evidence of injury being caused to the domestic industry by dumped imports of subject goods from subject countries,” DGTR said.

In a separate notification, the directorate has recommended an increase in import duty for two years on a Korean synthetic rubber used in tyre making after RIL had filed an application before the directorate in accordance with trade pact between India and South Korea for initiation of bilateral safeguard investigations concerning increased imports of this rubber.

The probe began in November last year.

For the first year, the DGTR has recommended to increase the rate of customs duty to the level of 100% of Most Favoured Nation applied rate of customs duty and 75% in the second year after it found a causal link between the increased imports of the goods due to the reduction or elimination of custom duty under the Korea-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and serious injury to the domestic industry.

“Accordingly, the director general recommends increasing the rate of customs duty on imports of subject goods (Polybutadiene Rubber) originating in Korea… to the level of Most Favoured Nation applied rate of customs duty...The measure is recommended for a period of two years”, it said.

The government on July 1, 2020, imposed safeguard measures by eliminating the concessions given under the FTA and increased the rate of custom duty to 10% on the imports of the product imported from Korea for 200 days."
"Market Movers: Reliance Industries cracks 4%, 23 stocks flash sell signal",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-movers-reliance-industries-cracks-4-23-stocks-flash-sell-signal/articleshow/78872664.cms,"Last Updated: Oct 26, 2020, 05:08 PM IST","NEW DELHI: Intense selling pressure in energy-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL) and banking majors dragged the benchmark equity indices down by over 1.25 per cent on Monday. As a result, investors on Dalal Street lost around 2 lakh crore as the market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms declined to Rs 158.60 lakh crore from Rs 160.59 lakh crore on Friday.

Overall, the BSE Sensex closed 540 points down at 40,145, while the NSE Nifty index settled nearly 163 points lower at 11,768.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Volatility was expected as we are nearing the US election date. The prices are high which limits the capacity of the market to handle uncertainties though the final outcome of the election is unlikely to change the long-term trend of the global market. The rising Covid-19 cases in the US, Europe and delay in US stimulus have added worries.”

Here is a lowdown on what happened in Monday’s trade:

Who dragged my Sensex down
Heavy selling in RIL alone wiped out nearly 250 points from the Sensex. The scrip tanked around 4 per cent after Amazon.com Inc won an interim arbitration award against its partner Future Group for selling its retail business to Reliance Industries for Rs 24,713 crore. Private lenders included HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank further dragged the 30-share index down by around 200 points.

Cosmo Films defies gravity
Shares of a smallcap firm Cosmo Films gained around 1 per cent after the company announced a buyback of 12.67 lakh shares at Rs 576, indicating a premium of over 23 per cent against the Friday’s close of Rs 467.25.

IndusInd Bank gains
Shares of IndusInd Bank also ended in the green after the promoters reaffirmed their ‘unstinted support’ to the bank while denying any talks with Kotak Mahindra Bank for a possible merger. The scrip settled 1.45 per cent up at Rs 616.25.

Kotak Mahindra Bank pares losses
Kotak Mahindra Bank pared its initial losses and settled 1.99 per cent higher after the lender reported a nearly 27 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone net profit at Rs 2,184.48 crore for the September quarter. Provisions also came much lower at Rs 368.59 crore, down 62 per cent QoQ and 9.64 per cent YoY. “Kotak Mahindra Bank’s management is known for its prudent and proactive stance on asset quality and provisions. Hence, lower provisions, along with a stable asset quality indicates improved outlook,” Sharekhan said.

Stocks that hit lower circuits
As many as 224 stocks hit lower circuit during the day. They included Reliance Infra, DHFL, Future Consumer, Himatsingka Seide, among others.

Most active counters
With a total traded quantity of 18.75 crore shares, YES Bank emerged as the most active stock on the NSE in terms of volume. It was followed by Reliance Power (13.68 crore), Vodafone Idea (9.23 crore) and Tata Motors (8.85 crore). On the other hand, Reliance Industries (Rs 3,535 crore), Coforge (Rs 1,412 crore), Hero MotoCorp (Rs 1,233 crore) and Tata Motors (Rs 1,199 crore) stood among the most active in terms of value.

Stocks that flash sell signals
23 stocks flashed sell on the BSE, as they slipped below the Signal Line on the MACD indicator. They included IDFC First Bank, Manappuram Finance, Bandhan Bank, Bajaj Auto, Jain Irrigation, Asian Paints, The Ramco Cements and Pidilite Industries, among others.

Promoter action: Dish TV India
Promoter group Direct Media Distribution Ventures and World Crest Advisors invoked the pledge on 2.76 crore and 17.75 lakh shares of Dish TV India on October 22, data available with BSE showed on October 26. The stock closed 2.78 per cent lower at Rs 11.88.

Where is Nifty headed?
Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President (Equity Technical Research), Kotak Securities, said Nifty formed a large black body candle which would not allow the market to sustain at higher levels. “The sell-off was so intense that the Nifty dropped to 20 days SMA without any meaningful support, which was at 11,715. Technically, the market is ready to hit the levels of 11,600 on the minimum side and in the worst-case scenario 11,428 levels,” he added."

 ""It is just, in the circumstance, to award interim relief to the Claimant to restrain and injunct the Respondents from taking any further steps in connection with the Disputed Transaction,"" he stated. The order ran into over 120 pages and was reviewed by BusinessLine.
Earlier this month, Amazon had sought intervention stating that the ₹25,000-crore deal between Future Group and Reliance Retail violated multiple rules of the 2019 agreement and was against the interest of Future Retail's shareholders.
The stock is currently trading at a day's low of ₹1,188 (-3.61%).

FRL tumbled 5.27% to Rs 73.70 while RIL fell 1.97% to Rs 2070.95 on the BSE today.
The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) passed an interim order asking Future Group to hold its sell-out plans to Reliance Group and wait for the final judgment on the plea filed by Amazon. The US-based retail giant had filed an arbitration petition with SIAC claiming that Future Group breached the contract under which the US online giant took an indirect stake in their retail business in 2019.
In a BSE filing made before market hours today, FRL said it was examining the communication and the order received from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).
""FRL has been legally advised that actions taken by the FRL / its board, which are in full compliance of the relevant agreements and eminently in the interest of all stakeholders cannot be held back in arbitration proceedings initiated under an agreement to which FRL is not a party,"" the company said.
It said that in any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay.
RIL's subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL) said that it had entered into the transaction for acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail under proper legal advice and the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian Law.
RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay, it added.
On 29 August 2020, RRVL announced acquisition of the retail & wholesale business and the logistics & warehousing business of the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,713 crore.
RIL said that the acquisition of the retail, wholesale and supply chain business of the Future Group complements and makes a strong strategic fit into Reliance's retail business.
Early in October, Amazon had sent a legal notice to Future Group citing its non-compete agreement with the Kishore Biyani-led chain. According to the notice, the Future-RIL transaction cannot go ahead without Amazon's approval in view of the non-compete clause entered earlier with the retail group.
Amazon has about 5% stake in FRL after it bought 49% in Future Coupons for Rs 1,500 crore last year in August.
The multinational online retailer reportedly said that the sale to RRVL violated the non-compete agreement and several related clauses mentioned in an August 2019 contract through which it had bought the stake in Future Coupons. As per Amazon, the contract stipulated that Future cannot sell any shares to any other competitor and that Amazon had the right of first refusal.

Reliance in April had cut the salary of employees of its hydrocarbons division by 10 per cent to 50 per cent with the firm’s chairman and richest Indian Mukesh Ambani agreeing to forgo all his remuneration.
Also, the oil-to-technology conglomerate had deferred annual cash bonus and performance-linked incentives that are normally paid in the first quarter.
Sources said Reliance may have done some intra-division cash transfer to roll back the salary cuts in the hydrocarbons divisions. An email sent to the company for comments remained unanswered.
Reliance’s hydrocarbon business was impacted due to a reduction in demand for refined products and petrochemicals after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb spread of coronavirus.
While Ambani had to forgo his entire ₹15-crore compensation, Reliance’s board of directors including executive directors, executive committee members, and senior leaders saw 30 per cent to 50 per cent cut in their compensation.
Employees with compensation of less than ₹15 lakh did not have any reduction in compensation but those earning higher than that saw a 10 per cent reduction in fixed pay. While the salary cuts of employees have been restored, it isn’t clear if Ambani’s remuneration has also been restored."

Interim order in favour of Amazon
Passing an interim award in favour of Amazon, single-judge arbitration panel of VK Rajah asked the Future group to put the deal on hold and said that the deal cannot go through until it finally decides the matter, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
Confirming the development, an Amazon spokesperson said that the arbitration panel has granted the reliefs sought by it and expect an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process.
""We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process,"" the Amazon spokesperson said.
Amazon believes Future Group violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.
The deal would have helped Reliance almost double its footprint as India's largest retailer.
Reliance responds
Meanwhile, commenting on the development, RIL retail arm Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) said it has been informed about the interim order passed by the emergency Arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings invoked by Amazon and it intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay.
""RRVL has entered into the transaction for acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail Limited under proper legal advice and the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian Law.
""RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,"" said RRVL.
What's the dispute?
With the dispute, Amazon is drawing the battle lines with Reliance in the race for India's estimated USD 1 trillion retail market, where online shopping is gaining ground. It needs the Indian partner to strengthen its foothold after becoming the authorized online sales channel for Future Retail's stores that sell everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel.
Amazon has slapped a legal notice on Future Group, alleging that the retailer's Rs 24,713 crore asset sale to Reliance Industries violated an agreement with the e-commerce giant and dragged the Future group firm into arbitration.
Earlier on August 29, 2020, the Future group had announced sale of its retail, wholesale and logistic etc to Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, the retail arm of the Reliance Industries.
Amazon, last year, had bought a 49% stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owns a 7.% stake in Future Retail.
The tussle between Future and Amazon comes at a time when Reliance has been bolstering its position in the country's retail segment.
Reliance Retail rise
Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd - run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani - has been on a fund raising spree and since September, it has raised Rs 37,710 crore crore by selling stake in its retail arm.
RRVL, operates India's largest, fastest-growing and most profitable retail business spanning supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets and online grocery store JioMart.
It operates about 12,000 stores in nearly 7,000 towns, with 640 million footfalls across core categories of grocery, consumer electronics and apparel. Revenues of Reliance Retail in FY20 stood at Rs 1.63 lakh crore.
The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats. The investments come as the country's retail sector prepares for the upcoming festival season and would help Reliance to launch an assault on rivals such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.
What's next?
A source said a three-member arbitration panel, with Future and Amazon appointing one representative each and a third member being a neutral umpire, would decide on the dispute in 90 days.
Amazon team was represented by Gopal Subramanium, Gourab Banerji, Amit Sibal and Alvin Yeo. While Future Retail side was represented by advocate Harish Salve, sources said.
Earlier on October 16, the hearing was concluded by the arbitration panel at Singapore International Arbitration Centre.

"Reliance Industries Rolls Back Salary Cuts Retrospectively, Expedites Performance Bonus",News18,https://www.news18.com/news/business/reliance-industries-rolls-back-salary-cuts-retrospectively-expedites-performance-bonus-3006293.html,"LAST UPDATED:
OCTOBER 25, 2020, 22:43 IST","Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is rolling back salary cuts for its employees and restoring them to the pre-Covid levels retrospectively, a significant marker of Indian industry’s recovery from the Coronavirus slump.
With 3.5 lakh direct employees in the group’s many businesses, the retrospective salary restoration and arrears would put money in the hands of the group’s employees during festival season.
RIL is also giving out performance bonus to employees of the hydrocarbons division that had been deferred in view of the Coronavirus-led uncertainties. The conglomerate is also offering an advance 30 per cent of the variable pay from the next year's salary to its lakh-plus employees as a goodwill gesture.
Reliance in April had cut the salary of employees of its hydrocarbons division by 10 per cent to 50 per cent with Chairman Mukesh Ambani forgoing all his remuneration for the financial year. The oil-to-technology conglomerate had also deferred annual cash bonus and performance-linked incentives.
While Ambani forgo his entire Rs 15 crore compensation, Reliance board of directors including executive directors, executive committee members, and senior leaders saw sizable cut in their pay. Employees with compensation of less than Rs 15 lakh did not have any reduction in compensation but those earning higher than that saw a 10 per cent reduction in fixed pay.
With this decision, India’s largest company has demonstrated leadership by not just restoring salaries to previous levels but also returning the difference, thus negating the wage reductions entirely.
At RIL, the COVID-19 management and employee care strategy was personally driven by Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani.
RIL Chairman has a reputation for prescience and spotting global economic and market trends early on. RIL group was among the first to embark on a belt-tightening drive last year itself. It also announced deleveraging and eradicated its large debt nine months ahead of schedule and that too in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic.
Network18 Media & Investment Ltd, which is owned by RIL, has also reversed the pay cut with retrospective effect, becoming first major Indian media company to restore pre-Covid salaries.

The firm is also offering an advance 30 per cent of the variable pay from the next year’s salary to its lakh-plus employees as a goodwill gesture for working during the pandemic, two persons familiar with the matter said.

Also, the oil-to-technology conglomerate had deferred annual cash bonus and performance-linked incentives that are normally paid in the first quarter.
Sources said Reliance may have done some intra-division cash transfer to roll back the salary cuts in the hydrocarbons divisions.
An email sent to the company for comments remained unanswered.
Reliance’s hydrocarbon business was adversely impacted due to a reduction in demand for refined products and petrochemicals after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb spread of coronavirus.
While Ambani forgo his entire Rs 15 crore compensation, Reliance board of directors including executive directors, executive committee members, and senior leaders saw 30 per cent to 50 per cent of their compensation.
Employees with compensation of less than Rs 15 lakh did not have any reduction in compensation but those earning higher than that saw a 10 per cent reduction in fixed pay. While the salary cuts of employees have been restored, it isn’t clear if Ambani’s remuneration has also been restored.

The US stock market finished higher after fluctuating in and out of the unchanged line throughout the session on Thursday, 22 October 2020. The gain was largely supported by better than expected economic data and the prospect of more fiscal stimulus to support a pandemic-damaged U.S. economy.
US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said a deal on new coronavirus aid was ""just about there"", despite continued opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate.

The existing home sales in the US soared by 9.4% to an annual rate of 6.54 million in September after jumping by 2% to a revised rate of 5.98 million in August, reflecting record-low interest rates and an abundance of buyers, the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday.

Indian economy set for a near double-digit contraction this FY
A consensus seems to be building on India's growth drop this year.
Reuters reports: ""The Indian economy will suffer its deepest contraction on record this fiscal year and recent government stimulus does not go far enough to significantly boost activity depressed by the coronavirus pandemic, according to economists polled by Reuters.
With over 7.6 million coronavirus infections, India is the second worst hit country in the world after the United States and the spread shows no signs of abating.
While the government has removed most restrictions imposed on businesses to slow the spread of the virus, the Reserve Bank of India issued gloomy economic forecasts earlier this month but kept interest rates unchanged citing rising inflation.
That puts the onus on the government, which last week announced another round of fiscal stimulus to boost demand by $10 billion.
But the Oct. 13-21 poll of 55 economists showed they were more pessimistic about this fiscal year's outlook than just two months ago.
Nearly 90% of economists, 34 of 39, who responded to an additional question said the latest government stimulus was not enough to boost the economy significantly.
“While the measures introduced to push consumer spending and capital expenditure are clearly innovative within the confines of fiscal prudence, they do little to move the needle significantly in terms of the growth outlook this (fiscal) year,” said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank.
After shrinking a record 23.9% in the April-June quarter, the Indian economy was forecast to contract 10.4% and 5.0% in the third and fourth quarter, respectively and merely stabilize in the first three months of 2021.
That compares with contractions of 8.1% and 1.0%, respectively, and 3.0% growth forecast in August.
For the current fiscal year ending March 31, Asia's third-largest economy was predicted to shrink 9.8%, more than the RBI's latest 9.5% projection, and 26 of 55 economists saw a contraction of 10% or more for the year.
The poll marks the seventh consecutive downgrade to this year's outlook and if confirmed, would be the weakest annual economic performance since records began six decades ago.
Although the economy was expected to grow 9.0% and 5.7% next fiscal year and in FY 2022-23, respectively, all but one of 36 economists with a view said it would take at least a year for Indian GDP to reach pre-COVID-19 levels.
Despite higher inflation projections, economists expect the central bank to be more concerned about reviving growth than price pressures driven by supply-side disruptions and to cut interest rates next quarter.
“The problem is we are unlikely to have any immediate assessment of the extent of durable damage to the supply chains in the economy. On the demand side, job losses and salary cuts mean lower demand for longer,” said Indranil Pan, chief economist at IDFC First Bank.
“Any onset of a second wave (of coronavirus) as is being witnessed elsewhere could derail the normalization process and put the projections in jeopardy.”""

Sentiment in real estate remains pessimistic in Jul-Sep, outlook turns positive: Survey
An update on the real estate scene.
PTI reports: ""The sentiment in the real estate industry remained pessimistic during July-September due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the outlook for the next six months has turned optimistic with signs of revival in demand, according to a survey.
Knight Frank-Ficci-NAREDCO on Thursday released their ‘Real Estate Sentiment Index Q3 2020 Survey’ of developers, banks, financial institutions and private equity players operating in the sector.
The ‘Current Sentiments Score’ improved to 40 points during the July-September period from a record low of 22 points in the previous quarter but remained in the pessimistic zone.
However, the ‘Future Sentiment Score’ is in the optimistic zone at 52 points, up from 41 in the previous quarter.
A score of above 50 signifies ‘Optimism’ in sentiments, a score of 50 means the sentiment is ‘Same’ or ‘Neutral’, while a score below 50 shows ‘Pessimism’
Knight Frank attributed the revival in sentiments to the “remarkable upturn seen in the real estate business, especially in the residential segment, in the third quarter of 2020 as a result of the unlocking process“.
About 57 per cent of the survey respondents opined that the economy is going to grow and improve in the next six months.
The funding outlook also improved compared to the previous quarter. 38 per cent of respondents opined that the scenario would be better in the coming six months, while 31 per cent felt that the current levels of credit availability would continue for the next six months.""

India’s export growth saw a decline of 6.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to third quarter of last year. However India recorded export growth of four per cent in September, it said.

Economy almost at doorstep of revival: Das
India’s economy is ‘almost at the doorstep of revival’, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das asserted on Wednesday, adding that banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) had raised, or were in the process of raising, capital to ensure adequate credit availability for businesses once the revival took hold.
The RBI’s monetary policy and the government’s fiscal policy were working in symmetry with an expansionary focus and an accommodative as well as counter-cyclical stance, Mr. Das said. The government would have to revisit its fiscal roadmap once the worst effects of the pandemic had been contained, he added.
Stressing the need for urgent governance reforms in both public and private sector banks and NBFCs, Mr. Das said this had been a lingering concern since the 2008 global financial crisis and needed attention.
“At this juncture, reforms in governance of banks and non-banking finance companies, especially in India, are very important. People mostly mix up banking reforms with ownership reforms,” he noted.

Indian shares track broader Asia lower, data breach report drags Dr Reddy's
The Indian benchmark stock indices are down broadly in line with other Asian bourses.
Reuters reports: ""Indian shares tracked broader Asia lower on Thursday, as global investors fretted over a setback to U.S. stimulus talks, while Dr.Reddy's Laboratories hit a five-week low following a report that a data breach prompted the drugmaker to shut key plants.
The NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.44% to 11,885.50 by 0457 GMT, while the S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.4% at 40,542.74.
Investor sentiment was dented globally as talks over a U.S. coronavirus aid bill faced a setback after President Donald Trump accused Democrats of being unwilling to craft an acceptable compromise on stimulus, following reports of progress earlier in the day.
Meanwhile, a Reuters poll signalled that a recent stimulus to boost demand by $10 billion in India, one of the hardest-hit nations by the pandemic, would not be enough to significantly lift business activity, with economists forecasting the economy was set for a near double-digit contraction this fiscal year.
“From an equity markets perspective, these (fall in GDP) are to some extent discounted the bigger risk is a second wave of virus and lockdowns, which could impact Q3 and Q4 economic growth,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal.
The Reserve Bank of India, which has already rolled out several measures to shore up liquidity in the pandemic-ravaged market, will conduct on Thursday its first-ever open market operation in state development loans.
Shares of Dr.Reddy's dropped 4.3% after ET NOW reported that the drugmaker had shut all key plants globally due to a data breach. The drugmaker's stock was the biggest loser in the Nifty 50.
The Nifty Bank Index, which gained nearly 5% so far this week, slipped 1.1% on Thursday, led by a 0.6% drop each in top lenders HDFC Bank and State Bank of India .

‘In order to export, you have to import’: Raghuram Rajan cautions against import substitution
Former Reserve Bank governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday cautioned against import substitution under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative of the government, saying the country has gone down this route earlier but could not succeed.
“If the focus (under Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative) is on import substitution by erecting tariffs, which we have done lot of in the last few years, then I think it is a direction we have tried before and it has failed. I would caution against going in that direction,” Mr. Rajan said.
He was addressing a webinar organised by the Centre for Financial Studies at Bhavan’s SPJIMR.
Mr. Rajan said in order to export, one needs to be able to import things that go into those exports as cheaply as it can.
“China’s rise as an export power came on the back of assembly. It brought in the stuff, put it together and exported it out. In order to export, you have to import. Don’t erect huge tariffs and focus on creating right environment for production in India,” he said.

Ambani succession is a chance to divide and rule,The Hindu Businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/ambani-succession-is-a-chance-to-divide-and-rule/article32898385.ece,"October 20, 2020","Mukesh Ambani can divide the $200-billion Reliance Industries conglomerate and still rule, if he wants to. India’s and Asia’s richest man has promised Silicon Valley investors that he will spin off telecommunications-to-technology unit Jio Platforms and Reliance’s retailing business from his oil-to-chemicals operations. That will leave three listed entities, and the 63-year-old Ambani has three children. But keeping family interests aligned is important, too.
Ambani has made no public statements about succession, but his adult children are stepping up. Akash has been announcing developments at Jio, backed by Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google and valued at up to $70 billion. Twin Isha is visible at Reliance Retail, valued at $57 billion by investors including Silver Lake and Mubadala.

It points to an easy separation of fiefdoms with valuations in the same ballpark. That might avoid a repeat of Ambani’s own Bollywood-worthy sibling feud after the death of his father, the founder of Reliance, at the age of 69 in 2002.
Family management
Even if the empire is divided, there is value in family unity. Reliance is 50.4 per cent owned by Ambani, his mother, wife, three kids and related entities. Larger business groups in emerging markets find it easier and cheaper to access credit and have more influence with regulators and lawmakers. Keeping things in the family has paid off for Reliance: the Indian company has delivered total shareholder returns three times better than the Nifty 50 over the past 15 years, Refinitiv data shows.
Reliance dismissed as speculative an August report in Mint newspaper of Ambani forming a family council, but it would be a step towards something rare: a family-owned business group that lasts multiple generations. The Agnellis, the Italian clan behind Fiat Chrysler and the Juventus football team, manage the interests of 100-plus family members through a council, though they have largely yielded management to professionals.
At Merck, another potential example, the founding family controls the centuries-old $19-billion German pharmaceutical and chemicals company through a board of partners that supervises the executive management. Something comparable at Reliance would be a contrast to Hong Kong’s Li Ka-shing, who in 2012 announced he would hand his companies to his eldest son and cash to the other. Ambani’s ambition in business suggests he wouldn’t shy away from seeking a legacy to rival the Mercks or Agnellis."

According to the richest man in Asia, this digital society will incorporate all the future industries in India in the next couple of years.
""I am working towards three things. The first is transformation of India into a digital society and that digital society incorporates all the future industries, so that the next 30 years of India is 100 times, like what we had never imagined,"" Ambani said during the launch of former bureaucrat NK Singh's book ""Portraits Of Power: Half A Century of Being at Ringside"" on Monday.
Sharing details about his second goal, Ambani said he wants to transform India's education sector. ""At any point in time, we have 200 million children in India in the education system. It will take us 8 to 10 years to completely transform the skill base of India,"" he said.

Mukesh Ambani said India has the calibre and capacity to ""convert the magic into reality"". He said India has the formula to establish linkages between academic institutions to the real world, skill training and employment in a way that can lead to a much higher standard of living and better jobs.
Ambani, who heads one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world, also elaborated on third goal -- the transformation of energy. He said the world as well as India are in the right mindset to completely move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next few decades.
""Be Atma Nirbhar and try and see if we can make our modest contribution in terms of the development of India,"" he said.

He said if he could succeed in these three things, he would consider the job done. During the event, Ambani also talked about the initial days of digital transformation at Reliance Industries Ltd. He shared memories when his father used to push for adoption of newer technologies that went beyond petrochemical and textile businesses to telecom, and gave birth to Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio).

Asian stocks rose with US futures after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for more progress with the White House on a fiscal stimulus deal before the November 3 presidential election. “We will be following the global cues from now till the U.S. elections unless a major local event happens. Locally, the expectations for the festive season’s demand and earnings season is also helping the sentiment,” Sameer Kalra, a strategist at Mumbai-based Target Investing, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
On Monday, 21 companies, including ACC, Britannia Industries, and HDFC Life, are set to report their quarterly earnings today.
In the opening trade, Sensex rallied over 300 points tracking strong gains in HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank amid positive cues from global markets. In the previous session, Sensex closed 254.57 points or 0.64% higher at 39,982.98 and Nifty settled 82.10 points or 0.70% up at 11,762.45.

Amazon’s legal suit prolongs wait for lenders to Future group,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/amazon-s-legal-suit-prolongs-wait-for-lenders-to-future-group/story-Syp5qehrmTAaM6BA0fCklL.html,"UPDATED ON OCT 19, 2020 06:09 AM IST","Lenders to Future group may see $3 billion worth of loans turning sour because of a delay in the sale of the Kishore Biyani-led group’s assets to Reliance Industries Ltd after Amazon.com Inc. dragged its Indian partner to a Singapore arbitration court to halt the deal.
While Future group firms owe close to ₹16,000 crore to a clutch of banks and debt mutual funds, Future group founder Biyani owes an additional ₹11,000 crore to several lenders. “While the loan exposures remain standard so far, several lenders have begun provisioning processes, anticipating delays in the deal,” said a senior banker directly involved in the transaction. “If the delay is inordinate, then most lenders will have no option but to make bigger provisions for these,” the person added.
Amazon has cited a clause in the company’s 2019 investment pact in Future Coupons Ltd that specifically bars the Future group from forging a pact with Reliance Industries, Mint reported on 16 October.
The US firm’s bid to void the Future Group’s asset sale to Reliance Industries jeopardizes not only the recovery of loans but also indicates that Amazon is ready to turn on the pressure on Reliance Industries, which is trying to grab a slice of the online market after emerging as India’s biggest offline retailer.
 Of the loans given to Future Group firms, a Bank of India-led consortium has the biggest exposure of ₹5,750 crore. Axis Bank lent ₹1,250 crore and Bank of Baroda ₹750 crore. The Future group also owes mutual funds that had invested in securities sold by group entities, including Rivaaz Trade Ventures, NuFuture Digital India and Future Ideas Co.
Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, a unit of India’s most valuable firm, on 29 August announced it would acquire Future Enterprises Ltd for ₹24,713 crore.
The transaction was the outcome of months of hard negotiations between lenders, Future group promoters and Reliance Industries, which finally resulted in a zero haircut on the debt for the lenders.
“Future group had thought the banks and mutual funds would start lending again, but this is unlikely to happen now,” said a corporate lawyer, adding that the arbitration proceedings put a question mark on the deal and also whether the Future group will be saddled with damages,” said second person, a senior banker.
Amazon.com sent a legal notice to Biyani on 8 October, calling the deal a breach of the 2019 agreement between Amazon and Future.
“If the arbitration delays the deal, we would not be surprised if Reliance Industries pulls out of the deal,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak Advisors, adding that if the current retail business goes down and then there is a huge amount of attrition in the perceived value of Future Retail, Reliance Industries may be left with only the leases of those retail stores. “Why would it want to pay ₹24,700 crore for the leases?”
Given that foreign direct investment in multi-brand retailing is not permitted, Amazon can’t acquire Future Retail’s businesses directly. It has, however, forged a tie-up with domestic private equity firm Samara Capital and had acquired grocery retail chain More from Aditya Birla group for roughly ₹4,200 crore in 2018.
Mint reported in June that Samara was in advanced talks to buy a stake in Kishore Biyani’s Future Retail. If a deal with Reliance is delayed or called off, Future may have to apply for restructuring its debt. However, without a viable business plan, lenders may find it difficult to approve such a recast.

In the Healthcare & Hygiene Expo, which was organized with industry body FICCI, top 15 Indian companies including BPL, Dabur, Raymond UCO and Sri Sri Tattva had made their presentations.
Indian mission in Guatemala was perhaps the only mission in Central America which during the global lockdown organized six major virtual meetings and exhibitions showcasing various sectors of India.
“Indian business establishments should look at this region with a strategy to expand market share and not just look at this region as small countries with small populations. “Minimum population and Maximum business share” should be the approach. Our products offer good quality at affordable prices. With sustained efforts, we will be able to increase our market share in these countries and that will provide adequate returns on investments,” Indian envoy to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, BS Mubarak, tells Financial Express Online.

Between June-September these virtual meetings and exhibitions gave insights to buyers from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in sectors like Healthcare & Hygiene; Indian Textiles; Food, Agriculture and Agro; Technology, FMCG Supply Chain; and SRTEPC Textiles.
Why so many meetings during global lockdown?
Ambassador BS Mubarak, says, “The lockdown due to COVID-19, gave us an opportunity to use the virtual platform to showcase various sectors. Large companies from various sectors here in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras showed interests and through these virtual meetings concerns related to distance, language etc were addressed.”
In the Healthcare & Hygiene Expo, which was organized with industry body FICCI, top 15 Indian companies including BPL, Dabur, Raymond UCO and Sri Sri Tattva had made their presentations to more than 100 companies from three Central American countries. “The response we got was very encouraging and through such BSMs and meets virtually, one gets not only networking without stepping out but is also able to network with companies in these countries, with tangible business transactions,” the Indian envoy to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras said.
According to Ambassador Mubarak, “The first virtual meet the mission organized was early June and it was for showcasing Indian Textiles. In fact, Textiles is one of the major export items in the region. The purpose was to give an insight into how the Indian companies are ready to do business post-COVID.”
Around twelve sellers including Britannia, Axess Seven, Jabs International, Dabur, Patson Foods and Swastik Gum Industries had showcased their products to over 80 buyers from during the Food, Agriculture and Agro meet in August. “Guatemala is a green country and they are already exporting to India. India based Jabs International is one of the biggest importers of commodity from Guatemala. This is the best time for Indian companies to be part of the supply chain in the region,” the envoy adds.
In an exclusive virtual meet organized by FICCI for Central America, held in August the FMCG Supply Chain expo had the Guatemalan Minister of Economy, Tony Malouf, as the chief guest. “Around 15 companies from India and more than 100 companies from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras had participated in the event. There are opportunities for Indian companies for ready to eat products, allied products, packaging, agritech, diesel engines and other machines. The countries in the region prefer Indian machinery.”

Last month, major textile companies from India including Aditya Birla Group, Nagreeka Group, Rachna Art Prints, Raymond, Reliance Industries Limited and Rughani Brothers presented their textile products to 60 buyers from the three countries which fall under the India mission. The presentations were made during the Synthetic and Rayon Textile Export Promotion Council (SRTEPC) online expo.
“Preferential trade agreements with individual countries and or creating Joint Economic Commissions to sort out trade-related issues and issues related to tariff and non-tariff barriers would help the companies to increase the footprints of the Indian companies,” a top diplomat told Financial Express Online.
Issues that need to be addressed
There is also an urgent need to reduce the time of transit for goods that are being exported from India. Presently it takes approximately 70 days for containers from India to reach Central America and The Caribbean. This must be brought down by engaging all stakeholders including shipping and logistic companies. Countries from the Far East are able to deliver goods in 30 days.
To establish warehousing facility as this will offset the issues related to time taken for Indian goods to reach Central America and the Caribbean. This strategy of holding stock has really helped some companies expand their market. “Until we have a solution for fast transport of goods, warehousing the facility can help us tackle this issue.”
Expert View
Sharing her views on the emerging opportunities in Central America, Dr Aparaajita Pandey, Asst. Prof, Institute of Public Policy, Amity University, NOIDA, says, “As India finally has begun looking to the far west as a potential opportunity for growth in trade and investment, our trade relations with Latin America and the Caribbean are on an upswing. However, most of the trade, investments, and political focus revolves around the larger South American nations like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, in limited context even Venezuela and Mexico in the north. The inherent bias of being a larger country gives India a tunnel vision in a region that we have just started to explore for possible partnerships.”
“This prejudice is in no way unique to India as most international trade partnerships around the world tend to focus on the geographical position of the country, it’s historical and present political position, and most importantly the size of its economy. This along with perpetual ignorance about the region has led India to overlook the potential that Central America has for investment, trade, and trade agreements,” she opines.
According to Dr Pandey, PhD from Centre for Latin American Studies, JNU, “Central American countries, though much smaller in size than their South American neighbours and admittedly with lesser resources have for the past half a decade consistently registered a higher growth rate than other sub-regions of Latin America. The nations of the region, even those riddled with violence have seen not just a growth in GDP higher than the rest of the region; they have also managed to grow immensely in the services sector, the same sector that is steadily becoming a shining beacon of the Indian economic matrix. In addition to a burgeoning services sector, the Central American region is also witnessing a digital revolution and is increasingly adopting IT and It solutions, thereby, providing India with convenient investment opportunities.”
“Another feature of the Central American region is its unification under the Central American Integration System (SICA). Unlike their South American brethren, who have a spaghetti bowl of intertwining regional organisation, each claiming to be representative of all of South America and each failing at it spectacularly; Central American countries are grouped under the umbrella organisation of SICA. This makes it easier to not only establish politico-economic relations but also negotiate trade pacts and agreements with the entire region as a whole. This is something that India has been trying to effectively manage in South America with limited success. Central America has propped itself quite well on the opportunities pedestal, that India must explore,” Dr Pandey concludes.

Future Group founder Kishore Biyani on Wednesday said the homegrown retail major lost nearly Rs 7,000 crore revenue in first three-four months of the COVID-19 pandemic due to closing of stores, which led him to sell his business to Reliance Industries.
In August this year, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries announced acquisition of retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business from the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,713 crore.
""We got into a trap to be very honest with COVID-19. In the first 3-4 months, we lost nearly Rs 7,000 crore of revenue,"" Biyani said at the Phygital Retail Convention.
There was no way the company could have survived losing such an amount, he said, adding the problem is rent doesn't stop, interest (on debt) doesn't stop.

""We did too many acquisitions in the last six-seven years... I thought there was no other answer but to exit,"" he stated.
He said for retailers the worst is yet to come.
""We have designed business to be profitable at 90 percent of our targets. In any scenario... we will not be able to touch 70-80 per cent (of target)... If you look at long-term planning 5 to 10 years -- it will not be easy for physical stores,"" he said.
In August this year, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries announced acquisition of retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business from the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for lumpsum aggregate consideration of Rs 24,713 crore.
Through the deal made in August with Reliance Industries, the Ambani led firm will acquire Future Retail that owns the BigBazaar that sells everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel, and Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd that operates fashion discount chain Brand Factory.
While Reliance will take over Future Consumer, which sells food, home and personal care products, Future Group's financial and insurance business is not part of the deal.
Future Retail operated 1,550 stores. Its flagship brands BigBazaar, FBB and Foodhall, Easyday, Heritage Fresh and WHSmith. Future Lifestyle Fashion operates 354 stores.
Investment from Reliance would help Future's founder Biyani pare debt.
Last week, US online retailer Amazon slapped a legal notice on Future Group, alleging that the retailer's Rs 24,713 crore asset sale to Reliance Industries violated an agreement with the e-commerce giant.
""We have initiated steps to enforce our contractual rights,"" a spokesperson for the Seattle-based e-commerce giant said. ""As the matter is sub-judice, we can't provide details.""
Amazon last year bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period between 3 and 10 years. Future Coupons owns a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.
In August this year, Future reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.
The deal is awaiting regulatory approvals."

Since mid-March, coronavirus infections started getting reported in the country, which has now become the second highest globally in terms of numbers.
The lockdowns severely dented economic activity, leading to a 23.9 per cent contraction in the gross domestic product (GDP) for the April-June period and expectations of a 9.5 per cent contraction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for 2020-21.

Excluding the investments in Jio Platforms (RIL's telecom arm) and Reliance Retail Ventures, investments by private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds for the January-September 2020 period have declined 53 per cent to USD 17.2 billion, the lowest in four years, EY's partner Vivek Soni said.
He expects the Indian PE/VC investments to close the year at around USD 24-28 billion, excluding the bets in Reliance arms.
From a deal count perspective, the number of transactions came down to 686 in January-September 2020 as against 764 in the corresponding period last year.
Last year's favourite sectors like infrastructure, real estate and financial services have witnessed significant decline in investment flow, while essential goods and services like pharma, telecom, digital technology and education technology have received a major chunk of investments, the firm said.
Real estate and infrastructure companies had garnered investments of USD 16.1 billion, accounting for 44 per cent of the overall investments last year, and the same has come down to USD 2.9 billion this year, it said.
Telecom was the top sector with a 10-fold increase to USD 10 billion invested across 13 deals, followed by financial services at USD 4.1 billion in 114 deals (a 32 per cent decline), technology with USD 2.3 billion invested across 106 deals (decline of 30 per cent), and a five-fold increase in pharmaceuticals with USD 1.9 billion invested across 27 deals. While all the deal segments reported a decline, buyouts were the worst hit, being 79 per cent down at USD 2.9 billion during the nine-month period which is lowest in three years.
With valuations impacted significantly, exits by the PE and VCs have also slowed, more than halving to USD 3.6 billion and are expected to remain muted for a considerable amount of time, it said.
Fundraising by such dedicated funds also nearly halved to USD 4.4 billion as the limited partners were focused on managing their larger public market portfolios and restricted their new commitments to tried and tested funds only, it said."

In August this year, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries announced acquisition of retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business from the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,713 crore.
""We got into a trap to be very honest with COVID-19. In the first 3-4 months, we lost nearly Rs 7,000 crore of revenue,"" Biyani said at the Phygital Retail Convention.

There was no way the company could have survived losing such an amount, he said, adding ""the problem is rent doesn't stop, interest (on debt) doesn't stop"".
""We did too many acquisitions in the last six-seven years... I thought there was no other answer but to exit,"" he stated.
He said for retailers the worst is yet to come.
""We have designed business to be profitable at 90 percent of our targets. In any scenario... we will not be able to touch 70-80 per cent (of target)... If you look at long-term planning - 5 to 10 years -- it will not be easy for physical stores,"" he said.
In August this year, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries announced acquisition of retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business from the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for lumpsum aggregate consideration of Rs 24,713 crore.
Through the deal made in August with Reliance Industries, the Ambani -led firm will acquire Future Retail that owns the BigBazaar that sells everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel, and Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd that operates fashion discount chain Brand Factory.
While Reliance will take over Future Consumer, which sells food, home and personal care products, Future Group's financial and insurance business is not part of the deal.
Future Retail operated 1,550 stores. Its flagship brands BigBazaar, FBB and Foodhall, Easyday, Heritage Fresh and WHSmith. Future Lifestyle Fashion operates 354 stores.
Investment from Reliance would help Future's founder Biyani pare debt.
Last week, US online retailer Amazon slapped a legal notice on Future Group, alleging that the retailer's Rs 24,713 crore asset sale to Reliance Industries violated an agreement with the e-commerce giant.
""We have initiated steps to enforce our contractual rights,"" a spokesperson for the Seattle-based e-commerce giant said. ""As the matter is sub-judice, we can't provide details.""

”Market may consolidate due to below than anticipated stimulus package and the large part of the positive Q2 results announced till date is well factored in the prices. ”The momentum may reverse into a narrow-range, in the near-term, while the undercurrent of the rally is still positive and a break-up is likely based on the continuity of positive results, more fiscal measures in the future and developments in the global market.

Future-RIL deal: Amazon’s arbitration proceedings against Future Group may start in Nov,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/future-ril-deal-amazons-arbitration-proceedings-against-future-group-may-start-in-nov/story/418465.html,"BusinessToday.In | October 10, 2020 | Updated 09:49 IST","Arbitration proceedings between Amazon and Future Group for its deal with Reliance Industries is expected to start in November. The proceedings in Singapore could go on for at least 9-12 months. Amazon has sent intimation notices alleging Future Group's compliance issue to Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), Future Group, its investors and shareholders.
The arbitration process is yet to start. It would require representation from all the parties including Amazon, Future and its investors. Amazon said that the Future Group did not seek permission from them before striking a deal with Reliance Industries. A company spokesperson said that Future did not seek required consent for the transaction and no consent was given by Amazon, as mentioned in a report in Business Standard. The Seattle-based giant is enforcing contractual obligations citing a non-compete agreement with Kishore Biyani's group and has sent them a legal notice.
Amazon had bought 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons for Rs 1,430 crore. Future Coupons owns 7.3 per cent in Future Retail, the daily stated. The deal between the two companies included a few conditions including a 'non-compete clause' and 'right of first refusal' clause. This meant that Future would need Amazon's approval to sell its shares. The ROFR clause also gave Amazon the right to be the first to invest in Future Retail if it decided to sell its shares. The non-compete ensured that Future could not deal with certain competing parties without prior approval from Amazon.
In August, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) announced a deal to acquire the entire retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses of the Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore. The deal is yet to be cleared for regulatory approvals.
The Biyanis were planning to expand their business and had raised capital to this end last year. They had taken personal loans and pledged their own shares as collateral. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the business as most of their stores are inside malls, stated the daily. As pressure to pay back the loans mounted, the Biyanis started to reach out to multiple investors to raise capital. However selling only Future Retail would have put brakes on plans to monetise other companies. Which is how RIL came into the scene.
Amazon, Flipkart and Reliance's JioMart are all competing with each other and eyeing a chunk of the online retail market in India.

The deal is awaiting regulatory approvals.
A source who is advising Future Group in this matter told PTI that Future Coupons received the notice from Amazon.
The person added that the Kishore Biyani-led group intends to settle this matter amicably, either through mediation or arbitration.
E-mail send to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Future Group did not solicit any response.
The development comes at a time when Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd - run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani - has been on a fund raising spree, bringing in well over Rs 37,700 crore in less than four weeks from global investors including Silver Lake, KKR, General Atlantic, Mubadala, GIC, TPG and ADIA.
Reliance Retail's network spans supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets and online grocery store, JioMart. It has a presence in nearly 7,000 towns, with 640 million footfalls across core categories of grocery, consumer electronics and apparel.
The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats. The investments come as the country's retail sector prepares for the upcoming festive season and would help Reliance to launch an assault on rivals such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.
The source also pointed out that Future Group had made an offer to Amazon, along with other potential buyers, and the deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RIL was signed only after the e-commerce behemoth declined it.
Moreover, as per Amazon's contract with Future Coupons, the US entity has first right to invest in Future Retail after three years and before ten years.
The deal with Amazon was also conditional based on the government's FDI policy permitting foreign multi-brand retailing firm. Given that there is no policy, they can't invest, the source said adding Amazon is raising this issue almost a month after the announcement of the deal with Reliance.
In August this year, Future Group had announced selling its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) - which operates the retail business of RIL - on a going concern basis for Rs 24,713 crore.

The fresh infusion comes just ahead of the festive season where the e-commerce giant will compete head-on against Walmart-owned Flipkart and billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries' JioMart.

Amazon Pay (India) has allotted 700,100,000 equity shares, aggregating to Rs 700.1 crore to the existing shareholder on rights basis, regulatory documents sourced by business intelligence platform Tofler showed.

The shares were allotted to Amazon Corporate Holdings Private Limited and Amazon.com.Incs Limited, the documents filed with the corporate affairs ministry showed.

Amazon did not respond to queries.

Amazon Pay competes with the likes of Flipkart's PhonePe, Alibaba-backed Paytm and Google Pay.

In January this year, Amazon Pay India had received Rs 1,355 crore from these entities.

Amazon has been pumping in millions of dollars across various operations like marketplace, wholesale and payments business as it looks to strengthen its position in the Indian market.

In September, a regulatory filing had shown that Amazon had infused fresh capital of Rs 1,125 crore into its Amazon Seller Services unit, while Rs 2,310 crore had been pumped into the business in June.

In January this year, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had announced USD 1 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) incremental investment in India to help bring small and medium businesses online.

Previously, the online retail giant had committed USD 5.5 billion investment in India, one of Amazon's most important markets outside of the US and a key growth driver."

Reliance Retail Venture, a holding company for Group's retail business, has big expansion plans. The recent acquisition of Kishore Biyani's retail, wholesale and logistic business clearly shows the organic as well as inorganic ambitions of Ambanis in the modern retail business. Two big trends that are driving high growth in modern retail are digitisation and the gradual shifting of unorganised retail into organised retail.
The fresh fund infusion of Rs 11,650 crore is part of the company's plan to increase the capital base. The company had recently increased its authorised capital base from Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore.

There is already a rush of investors to be part of the Reliance's retail journey. In a month's time, Reliance Retail Venture has attracted billion dollar investors from global marquee names. The company has raised Rs 37,710 crore from sovereign funds and private equity investors like Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Silver Lake, General Atlantic, Mubadala, GIC, TPG and ADIA.
The current investment of Rs 37,710 crore translates into an equity stake of over 8 per cent. Sources suggest there are more investors lined up to invest in the retail venture.

The current investments in Reliance Retail have already valued the retail arm at around Rs 4.2 lakh crore. In fact, Jio Platforms, the digital business, had recently attracted huge investors interest from global funds and strategic investors, which had pegged its enterprise value at over Rs 5.15 lakh crore.
These higher valuations in the retail and digital arm are getting reflected in the parent RIL's market capitalisation. In little over a year, RIL's market cap has doubled to Rs 15 lakh crore.
The company's retail business with 12,000 stores is already up and running. The company reported consolidated revenues of Rs 1.62 lakh crore and net profits of Rs 5,448 crore in FY20.

“India missed out on the first two industrial revolutions and the changes brought about by them. During the third industrial revolution, where Information Technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders,” Ambani said in his speech at ‘TM Forum's Digital Transformation World Series 2020’ conference.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driven by the convergence of digital and physical technologies such as digital connectivity, Cloud and Edge computing, IoT and smart devices, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain, AR and VR and genomics.
“Today, I can say with utmost confidence that India will play a leading role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” he added.
Stating that The Fourth Industrial Revolution has presented a unique opportunity to create unprecedented value and prosperity, Ambani said India much invest in building next-generation technology assets, rootout inefficiencies across the digital physical ecosystem and break silos and forge winning partnerships.
Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) was conceived for India to enable this journey, he said at the virtual conference.
Data consumption
RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, built its 4G network in three years, compared with the 25 years it took for the Indian telecom industry to build the 2G network, he said.
“And to ensure widespread adoption of data, we launched with the lowest data tariffs in the world and made voice services completely free for RJio users,” he added.
RJio added seven customers every second and garnered 100 million users in 170 days of its launch, and India’s monthly consumption went up from 0.2 billion GB to 1.2 billion GB, a 600 per cent growth.
Today, India consumes over 6 exabytes of data every month.
“We have gone from 155th in the world to number one in mobile data consumption in just four years.”
RJio is now rolling out a high-speed, low-latency optic fibre network to more than 50 million homes and premises across 2,000 towns and cities in India and is preparing for rolling out 5G services across the country, he added."

""We have initiated steps to enforce our contractual rights,"" a spokesperson for the Seattle-based e-commerce giant said. ""As the matter is sub-judice, we can't provide details.""

Amazon last year bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period between 3 and 10 years. Future Coupons owns a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.
In August this year, Future reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.
The deal is awaiting regulatory approvals.

A source who is advising Future Group in this matter told PTI that Future Coupons received the notice from Amazon.
The person added that the Kishore Biyani-led group intends to settle this matter amicably, either through mediation or arbitration.
E-mail send to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Future Group did not solicit any response.
The development comes at a time when Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd - run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani - has been on a fund raising spree, bringing in well over Rs 37,700 crore in less than four weeks from global investors including Silver Lake, KKR, General Atlantic, Mubadala, GIC, TPG and ADIA.
Reliance Retail's network spans supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets and online grocery store, JioMart. It has a presence in nearly 7,000 towns, with 640 million footfalls across core categories of grocery, consumer electronics and apparel.
The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats. The investments come as the country's retail sector prepares for the upcoming festive season and would help Reliance to launch an assault on rivals such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.
The source also pointed out that Future Group had made an offer to Amazon, along with other potential buyers, and the deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RIL was signed only after the e-commerce behemoth declined it.
Moreover, as per Amazon's contract with Future Coupons, the US entity has first right to invest in Future Retail after three years and before ten years.
The deal with Amazon was also conditional based on the government's FDI policy permitting foreign multi-brand retailing firm. Given that there is no policy, they can't invest, the source said adding Amazon is raising this issue almost a month after the announcement of the deal with Reliance.

"Marketing freedom: Govt allows Reliance, others to sell gas to affiliates",Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/marketing-freedom-govt-allows-reliance-others-to-sell-gas-to-affiliates-120100701044_1.html,"Last Updated at October 7, 2020 18:59 IST","In a major boost to firms such as Reliance Industries, the government on Wednesday allowed affiliate companies to buy gas produced from non-regulated fields as part of giving complete marketing freedom.
The government between 2016 and 2019 gave pricing freedom for all fields except those given to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) on a nomination basis.
But, there were restrictions on marketing including a ban on affiliates of producers buying the fuel and in some cases, a state nominee being mandated to offtake the gas. This restricted competition kept prices artificially low.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved natural gas marketing reforms, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters here.
There will be no change in the price of gas sold by ONGC and OIL from fields given to them on a nomination basis. The rate at USD 1.79 per million British thermal unit is half of the production cost.
He said the CCEA approved a standard procedure for discovering the price of gas through a transparent and competitive e-bidding as also ""permitting affiliates to participate in the bidding process for the sale of gas"".
Complete marketing freedom has been provided where production sharing contracts (PSCs) already provide for pricing freedom. This would benefit firms such as Vedanta-owned Cairn and Focus Energy who can now sell fuel to anyone and not necessarily to state-owned GAIL.
""This will add 40 million standard cubic metres per day of production from Krishna-Godavari basin and other areas to the current output of 84 mmscmd,"" Pradhan said.
He said the ban on producers buying their own gas will continue to prevent manipulations.
But, their affiliates can participate in the auction for the discovery of price and buying the gas, he said.
Last year, Reliance and its partner BP had bid out 5 mmscmd of new gas from their KG-D6 block to firms such as Essar and GSPC.
Reliance and BP were keen to buy the gas but rules did not allow. Now, India Gas Solutions Pvt Ltd, an equal joint venture of Reliance and BP, will be allowed to bid and buy the gas.
""The objective of the policy is to prescribe a standard procedure to discover the market price of gas to be sold in the market by gas producers, through a transparent and competitive process,"" he said.
He added that it permits affiliates to participate in the bidding process for the sale of gas and allows marketing freedom to certain field development plans (FDPs) where PSCs already provide pricing freedom.
Pradhan said the policy aims to provide a standard procedure for the sale of natural gas in a transparent and competitive manner to discover market price by issuing guidelines for sale by the contractor through e-bidding.
""This will bring uniformity in the bidding process across the various contractual regimes and policies to avoid ambiguity and contribute towards ease of doing business,"" he said.
He, however, said re-bidding will be done in case only the affiliates participate in the auction.
""These reforms will build on a series of transformative reforms rolled out by the government in the past several years,"" he said.
In February 2019, the government gave ONGC and Reliance Industries pricing and marketing freedom for yet-to-be-developed discoveries and agreed to levy a lesser royalty in case of state-owned firms raising production from existing fields.

"Jio deal to involve ‘limited’ data sharing for ecommerce transactions, Facebook tells CCI",Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/limited-data-sharing-in-jio-deal-fb-to-cci/articleshow/78524705.cms,"Last Updated: Oct 08, 2020, 09:43 AM IST","New Delhi: Facebook assured the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that its investment in Jio Platforms will only involve exchange of “limited data” related to facilitating ecommerce transactions, according to the regulator’s order made public on Tuesday. CCI, however, warned both sides that anti-competitive conduct resulting from data sharing in the future could be taken up by the regulator.

CCI had approved the acquisition of a 9.99% stake in Reliance Industries Ltd-owned Jio Platforms by Facebook entity Jaadhu for ₹43,574 crore in June. The Facebook unit told CCI that neither company will acquire each other’s data, according to the order, dated June 24.

As per their commercial arrangement, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and JioMart, owned by Reliance Retail Ventures and operated by Jio Platforms, will send and receive “limited data”.

‘Data Sharing Not Purpose of Deal’
That’s solely for the purpose of facilitating ecommerce transactions on JioMart, the Facebook unit said. “Data sharing” was not the purpose of the acquisition, the order cited it as saying.

“Its use is limited, proportionate and solely for the purpose of implementing the Proposed Commercial Arrangement,” the Facebook unit said, adding that the Master Services Agreement explicitly prohibited the partners from using confidential information received from the other side for their own business purposes or disclosing it to third parties.

“This data is neither exclusionary, inimitable nor rare and substitutes exist,” Jaadhu told CCI, adding that it will be “processed in accordance with applicable law and parties’ data policies”.

Facebook didn’t respond to queries sent Tuesday evening.

The commission observed that Jio Platforms unit Reliance Jio Infocomm was a prominent telecommunications company with more than one-third of the country’s mobile users on its network. It noted that the Facebook group is ranked second in online advertising and leads in online display advertisement services. User data possessed by entities involved are complementary to each other, given the symbiotic interface between the telecommunications business and over-the-top (OTT) content and application users, CCI observed.

“Thus, any anti-competitive conduct resulting from any data sharing in the future could be taken up by the commission under Sections 3 and/or 4 of the Act having due regard to the dynamics of the concerned markets and position of the parties therein,” said the order

While Section 3 of the Competition Act deals with the regulation of combinations, Section 4 prohibits abuse of a dominant position.

CCI said the transaction may not result in unrestricted access to each other’s resources, including user data. “Nevertheless, the parties may have incentives to engage in mutually beneficial data sharing. In this regard, Jaadhu has submitted that ‘there is no data to be shared as part of the proposed transaction’,” it said.

The CCI said it’s of the opinion that the proposed combination is not likely to have any appreciably adverse effect on competition in India. “Therefore, the commission approves the proposed combination under Section 31(1) of the Act,” it said.

Facebook led investments in Jio Platforms over a three-month period that saw Reliance raise a total of over ₹1.52 lakh crore from Google, General Atlantic and Silver Lake, among others. RIL said in early July that it had received ₹43,574 crore from the Facebook unit for the 9.99% stake."

Reliance scraps merger of Viacom18 with Sony after ‘strategic rethink’,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/reliance-calls-off-merger-of-viacom18-with-sony-after-strategic-rethink-120100500845_1.html,"Last Updated at October 5, 2020 17:39 IST","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has called off the proposed merger of his group's entertainment business with Sony Pictures Networks India following a strategic rethink.
Ambani's television networks housed in Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd were to merge with Sony Corp, with the Japanese giant having a bigger stake in the merged entity.
However, Reliance has now had a rethink and has decided not to pursue the merger route, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
Instead, the company is now keen to invest more in digital content creation.
Digital media and entertainment is an essential pillar of telecom unit Jio's digital business strategy, they said adding Reliance plans to invest aggressively and grow the digital media business.
Reliance, they said, wants to retain management control over the digital operations and invest behind creating India's No.1 OTT destination as well as a broadcast platform.
Also, entertainment is central to Jio's FTTH plans in partnership and collaboration with other content and production companies.
There is a lot of interest from content companies and production houses in partnering with Reliance and Jio, and investors are keen to back such partnerships, they said.
An email sent to Reliance for comments remained unanswered.
Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd is a joint venture between TV18 Broadcast Ltd and Viacom Inc. TV18 owns 51 per cent share in the unit.
Currently, Viacom18 operates more than 40 channels in seven languages.
It also operates a film company, Viacom18 Motion Pictures, video streaming platform Voot, has interests in live events and merchandising, besides a distribution company, IndiaCast Media.
Sony Pictures Networks India, on the other hand, a subsidiary of Sony Corp., runs more than 20 channels, including several sports networks.
Sources said Reliance was no longer keen for a deal especially after the introduction of the fibre-to-home strategy that provides access to 12 OTT (over-the-top) streaming apps including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, JioCinema, Zee5, Sony Liv, Voot, Alt Balaji, Sun NXT, Shemaroo, Lionsgate Play, and Hoichoi.
Initially, Reliance was looking at the deal with Sony to boost its content pipeline.
Reports also suggested differences had cropped up between Reliance and Sony over the Japanese firm getting the majority stake in the merged entity. Reliance demanded a majority stake which was not immediately agreed to by Sony.

Reliance develops RT-PCR kit that can give COVID-19 results in 2 hours,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/reliance-develops-rt-pcr-kit-that-can-give-covid-19-results-in-2-hours/articleshow/78444872.cms,"Last Updated: Oct 02, 2020, 03:48 PM IST","New Delhi: Reliance Life Sciences has developed an RT-PCR kit that promises diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in about 2 hours, company sources said. At present, COVID-19 RT-PCR test, which is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, takes up to 24 hours to give a diagnosis.

The sources said computational biologists at Reliance Life Sciences, a subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 % Ltd, analysed more than 100 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in India and designed unique RT-PCR primers for developing quantitative-Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) kit for COVID-19 detection.

RT-PCR kit is so far considered as Gold standard.

The kit, developed by scientists at Reliance Life Sciences, is named R-Green Kit (SARS COV2-real-time PCR) and has been technically validated by ICMR for satisfactory performance, the sources said.

ICMR's validation process does not approve/disapprove the kit design as well as it does not certify user-friendliness.

The sources said the kit can detect the presence of E-gene, R-gene, RdRp gene of SARS COV2 virus with Actin as an internal control.

As per ICMR results, the kit shows 98.7 per cent sensitivity and 98.8 per cent specificity.

This kit is a complete indigenous development by the R&D scientists working at the firm, they said, adding one biggest advantage of this kit is that it is simple to use and uses readily available simple reagents and primers which can be synthesised in India.

The diagnosis time is approximately 2 hours, they added.

A separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for COVID-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020.

The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.

Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology.

It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 per cent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).

In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries.

Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of COVID-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.

Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death.

The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent."
Reliance Industries to buy 2 million barrels of Canadian heavy crude to offset Venezuelan decline,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/reliance-industries-to-buy-2-million-barrels-of-canadian-heavy-crude-to-offset-venezuelan-decline/story/417627.html,"Reuters | October 2, 2020 | Updated 15:18 IST","Reliance Industries has agreed to purchase two million barrels of Canadian heavy crude per month, three industry sources said, as a substitute for dwindling Venezuelan supply. The deal, large for Canada, shows how global buyers are scrambling for new sources of heavy oil. Venezuela's production has collapsed over the last several years, and US sanctions have squeezed its ability to sell oil to international buyers, including Reliance Industries.
The refiner, which operates the largest refining facility in the world, is among several companies winding down purchases from Venezuela as a result of US sanctions.
Reliance Industries' purchases from Canada will last for six months, two sources said, while a third said it was confirmed for at least the fourth quarter.
With ""Venezuela's collapse in production, (demand) needs to be met by someone"", said a Canadian industry source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Bloomberg first reported the sale. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment. Mexico, another major producer of heavy crude, has also seen production fall, as state oil firm Pemex has been hobbled by debt.
Canada is heavily dependent on oil sales to the United States, which purchased 97 per cent of the country's exported crude in July, the most recent Statistics Canada data available.
The Canadian oil industry has struggled for years with deep discounts for its heavy crude, due largely to congested pipelines that carry it to US refiners. This year, producers have curtailed production as the pandemic has crushed demand, which has helped elevate prices.
Canadian heavy crude for November delivery traded on Thursday for $10.80 per barrel less than the North American benchmark, according to NE2 Canada Inc.

According to Morgan Stanley, the implied valuations in the General Atlantic deal are slightly higher versus the last two transactions due to the completion of a cash infusion in Reliance Retail by Silver Lake.
The investment in RRVL by GA comes within a month of US private equity firm Silver Lake and KKR making a total investment of Rs 13,050 crore in the retail venture of RIL. Thus within this month, the retail firm has sold a total of 3.9% stake raising funds worth Rs 16,725 crore.
Even though Reliance Retail is ahead of its peers when it comes to digitisation of its services, it will need to make large investments to consolidate the back-end and digitise operations to take on Amazon and Flipkart. Brokerage firm UBS had earlier said the digitisation and consolidation process requires higher capex and that Reliance Retail is on course to raise capital for the same.
Commenting on the transaction with GA, Reliance Industries CMD Mukesh Ambani said, “We look forward to leveraging General Atlantic’s extensive expertise at the intersection of technology and consumer businesses, and two decades of experience investing in India, as we create a disruptive new commerce platform to redefine retail in the country.”
Reliance Retail has acquired Future Group’s retail business, which has a portfolio of strong retail assets across grocery, fashion and lifestyle. This would add around 1,300 stores to its current 800 stores in grocery and 440 stores in fashion and lifestyle, thus taking its total network to 2,400. With the acquisition of Future Group’s assets, Reliance Retail’s share in the organised retail market is expected to be in the region of 15% after this merger, and the retailer now accounts for nearly 10% sales of top FMCG firms.
Reliance Retail has already marked its entry into the e-commerce business with the launch of JioMart in a tie-up with Facebook’s popular platform WhatsApp to take on the likes of big players like Amazon and Flipkart. JioMart has already been launched in around 200 cities. Analysts maintain that like Jio Platforms, other financial and strategic investors may also invest in Reliance Retail. Jio Platforms has attracted investments from 13 global investment firms investing Rs 1,18,318.45 crore for a 25.24% stake.
“The swift pace of developments at Reliance Retail may raise investor concerns for peers like DMart, Trent etc. We, however, note that India offers significant opportunity given favourable demographics, a huge unorganised market and hence, there is growth headroom for peers as well,” Jefferies had said earlier.
General Atlantic is a leading global growth equity firm with a 40-year track record of investing in the technology, consumer, financial services and healthcare sectors. It has backed companies like Airbnb, Alibaba, Ant Financial, Box, ByteDance, Facebook, Slack, Snapchat, Uber and other global technology leaders.
General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford said, “General Atlantic shares Reliance Industries’ foundational belief in the power of technology to foster transformative growth, and we are excited by the immense potential of the full Reliance ecosystem.”
Reliance Retail clocked revenues of Rs 31,633 crore, which was lower by 17.2% on a year-on-year basis for the quarter ended June 30. The company’s Ebitda during the quarter fell by 47.4% y-o-y to Rs 1,083 crore. The Ebitda margins came in 220 basis points lower on a y-o-y basis at 3.8%.
The company operated total area of 29 million sq ft during the quarter, which was up by 26% on a y-o-y basis. On a full-year basis, for FY20, Reliance Retail had recorded revenue of Rs 1,62,936 crore, up 24% compared with FY19. The company’s Ebitda was up 55.7% to `9,654 crore for the full year ended March 31, 2020.

SEPTEMBER 30, 2020, 16:20 IST","The personal net worth of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani rose by 73 per cent to Rs 6.58 lakh crore, helping him retain the title of being the richest Indian for the ninth consecutive year with a wider margin, according to a report released on Tuesday. Ambani, 63, who has been selling stakes in telecom and retail arms lately leading to a strong performance in the Reliance Industries stock price, is also in the top five at a global level, the report prepared by Hurun in association with IIFL Wealth said.
The rankings come at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a deep economic impact on the lives and fears are being expressed about a K-shaped recovery, which will result in more inequalities in the society. The list identified 828 Indians who are worth over Rs 1,000 crore as of August 31 and made it to the list of richest Indians. Cyrus Mistry and Shapoor Mistry of Shapoorji Pallonji group, which is seeking nearly Rs 1.78 lakh crore for its 18 per cent stake in Tata Sons, saw a 1 per cent decline in their wealth at Rs 76,000 crore each.
Gujarat-based Gautam Adani, who is diversifying into many businesses, saw a 48 per cent rise in his wealth to Rs 1.40 lakh crore and moved up two places in rankings to being the fourth richest Indian. Hinduja Brothers, who are reported to be in a property dispute, are worth Rs 1.43 lakh crore and were able to retain the second standing despite a 23 per cent reduction, according to the list. They are followed by HCL's Shiv Nadar and family whose fortunes rose 34 per cent to Rs 1.41 lakh crore.
Wipro's Azim Premji slipped two places to fifth in the rankings with fortunes of Rs 1.14 lakh crore. The world's largest vaccine maker Serum Institute of India's Cyrus Poonawalla had a 6 per cent rise in wealth at Rs 94,300 crore and was at sixth place. D-Mart's Radhakishan Damani and family broke into the top-ten with a 56 per cent rise in wealth to Rs 87,200 crore. Kotak Mahindra Bank promoter Uday Kotak saw an 8 per cent reduction in his networth to Rs 87,000 crore, slipping one place to being the eighth richest Indian.
On the back of a blockbuster IPO, 77-year-old Ashok Soota of Happiest Minds debuted on the list with a networth of Rs 3,700 crore, it said. The financial capital continues to have an edge over the national capital in being home to rich Indians, while among the global Indians, the US has the highest numbers in the rich list. Only 40 of the 828 individuals or 5 per cent of the list are women, with 69-year-old Smita Crishna of Godrej leading with a networth at Rs 32,400 crore and Kiran Majumdar Shaw of Biocon trailing her with Rs 31,600 crore networth. Hurun's managing director for India and chief researcher Anas Rahman Junaid said there is possibility of missing two individuals for every one included in the list, and pegged the total number of those worth over Rs 1,000 crore at 3,000."

General Atlantic's investment will translate into a 0.84% equity stake in Reliance Retail on a fully diluted basis. This marks the second investment by General Atlantic in RIL, following an Rs6,598.38cr investment in Jio Platforms announced earlier.

Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, said, ""Like Reliance Retail, General Atlantic believes in the fundamental ability of digital enablement to drive progress, growth, and inclusion across India and the world. We look forward to leveraging General Atlantic’s extensive expertise at the intersection of technology and consumer businesses, and two decades of experience investing in India, as we create a disruptive New Commerce platform to redefine retail in the country.”

General Atlantic’s money will translate into a 0.84% equity stake in Reliance Retail on a fully diluted basis.

This is General Atlantic's second investment in a subsidiary of Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 %, following a Rs 6,598.38 crore investment in Jio Platforms announced earlier this year.

Reliance Retail is on a fund raising spree and has secured around $1.8 billion in the past few weeks from KKR & Co and Silver Lake Partners.

Reliance, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, has approached investors, who collectively pumped more than $20 billion into its Jio Platforms digital business this year, to take stakes in its retail business, which has nearly 12,000 stores and sells everything from groceries and electronics to fashion and shoes.

“I am pleased to extend our relationship with General Atlantic as we work towards empowering both merchants and consumers alike, and ultimately transforming Indian Retail,"" Ambani said in a statement.

Global investors are vying for a piece of India’s burgeoning $800 billion annual retail market that is expected to swell to $1.3 trillion in the next few years. Reliance Retail, as the market leader, is well placed to corner a chunk of that market with its combination of brick-and-mortar retail and its JioMart ecommerce initiative. Reliance is planning to combine its network of about 12,000 physical outlets with JioMart and enlist millions of kirana shops as last-mile delivery agents in its multi-channel New Commerce initiative.

JioMart rolled out services in 200 cities in May selling food and grocery. It plans to extend its portfolio to fashion and electronics in the coming months to take on Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon directly.

RIL is looking to raise Rs 60,000-63,000 crore by selling about 15% of Reliance Retail to a bevy of global investors and induct an overseas strategic investor. ET had also reported that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Firm, Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Investment, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, KKR and L Catterton are likely to pick up stakes."

NEW DELHI| BENGALURU: India’s super-rich have grown their wealth by 20% during Covid, which is twice as fast as the growth in the net market capitalisation of all listed companies. Also, the number of people having more than Rs 1,000 crore in the IIFL Wealth Hurun Rich List has increased by 94 in 2020 to 828.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of India’s most valued company Reliance Industries NSE 3.63 %, continues to top the list with a wealth of Rs 6.6 lakh crore. His total wealth increased by 73% in the last 12 months, making him the richest Asian and the fourth-richest in the world.

The cumulative value of the 828 individuals on the list stood at $821 billion (Rs 60,59,500 crore), an increase of $140 billion (Rs 10,29,400 crore) over the 2019 count, a large part of which was due to the rise in share price of Reliance Industries.

Among the startups, with a wealth of Rs 13,100 crore each, Amod Malviya, Sujeet Kumar and Vaibhav Gupta — former Flipkart executives — had their wealth increase by 274% on account of strong investor interest in their new venture Udaan, a B2B e-commerce portal, and topped the list of biggest gainers for the second consecutive year. The valuation of Udaan increased from Rs 20,000 crore in October 2019 to Rs 52,500 crore in February 2020.

Others of Indian origin include Ajaypal Singh Banga of Mastercard (Rs 7,200 crore), Nikesh Arora of Palo Alto Networks (Rs 6,500 crore), Satya Nadella of Microsoft (Rs 5,900 crore), Sundar Pichai of Alphabet (Rs 5,900 crore), and Indra Nooyi formerly of PepsiCo (Rs 3,500 crore). With Rs 3,200 crore, Ignatius Navil Noronha of Avenue Supermarts NSE -2.45 % is the richest CEO based in India.

The cut-off for the top 10 rose by 6% to Rs 76,000 crore this year. Top 100 individuals in the list account for nearly 64% wealth of the latest edition of the rich list for 2020.

The ninth edition of the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2020 compiled the richest individuals having a wealth of Rs 1,000 crore or more as on August 31, 2020. However, Hurun India MD and chief researcher Anas Rahman Junaid felt that this was not an exhaustive list. He said, “Assuming that for every one Hurun rich lister we have found, we have probably missed two, it is likely that India today has 3,000 individuals with Rs 1,000 crore”.

Among the sectors, pharmaceuticals, with 122 super-rich individuals on the list, leads the pack, followed by chemicals & petrochemicals with 55 individuals and software & services with 50 individuals. Automobile & auto components, food & beverages, manufacturing, construction & engineering, etc, are some of the other significant contributors to the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2020. Interestingly, this time the super-rich came from 111 cities of the country."

The short term trend of Nifty continues to be positive and one may expect further upside in the market for the short term.
Domestic equity market benchmarks BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 started the week on a strong footing, gaining over 1.5 per cent coupled with positive global cues. BSE Sensex ended 593 points or 1.59 per cent up at 37,982, while the broader Nifty 50 index jumped 177 points or 1.60 per cent to close at 11,227. Index heavyweights such as ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC, Bajaj Finance and Reliance Industries (RIL) were among the top index contributors. The broader market outperformed equity benchmarks.

Global markets: European stocks jumped in Monday’s session with FTSE up 1.51 per cent, DAX up 2.83 per cent and CAC up 2.09 per cent. “European stocks partially recovered from last week’s hefty losses on Monday, helped by bargain shopping by foreigners, upbeat industrial profits data from China and as banking stocks bounced off record lows,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. Asian stock markets too gained on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1.32 per cent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.04 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi added 1.29 per cent.
Technical take: “The markets kept the upward momentum on for the entire day. However, the level to watch out for is 11300-11350. We need to get past and close above that price zone. That would signal that an intermediate bottom has been made and we have entered into an uptrend. Until then, there is always a possibility of a U-turn from the current levels and the Nifty might attempt to go and test the 10750 level,” said Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments.

RIL shares fell to a 52 week low of Rs 867.82 on March 23 a day when India announced a 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. Since then, RIL- India's most-valued company-has seen its stock jump 172% to its all-time high of Rs 2,368.80 on September 16, 2020.
Mukesh Ambani-led RIL has logged the highest ever M-cap by an Indian company, with the index heavyweight stock hitting multiple 52 week highs this year. The earnings of the world's largest oil refining complex have skyrocketed amid increased profitability, giving stock returns of 72.3% in one year and 45.5% since the beginning of this year. The share has surged over 5% in a month.
Amid reports that a Reliance-Amazon deal was in the works, the Mumbai-headquartered RIL hit the milestone as the first Indian company to cross the staggering Rs 16 lakh crore market-cap mark on September 16, 2020.

RIL has offered an opportunity for investors to ride the growth wave of the digital and tech sector. This is despite most rating agencies suggesting that RIL's current market cap offers no upside based on deal benchmark valuations. Brokerages also expect small corrections in the stock in the near-term as it has exhausted its large-near term triggers.
But the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has also been compared with giants like Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent etc. who have been able to create long-term shareholder value. The stock has also performed well within the peers in the Indian market, through expanding its businesses further to various segments such as telecom, retail.
RIL's approach of owning the pipeline as well as the services offered on the pipeline, has helped generate loyal customers today. Having a significant play in the Indian economy, RIL, through its enormous customer base in telecom and retail has been the safest bet for investors in such volatile times.
RIL share falls 2% despite report firm in race to buy British retailer Debenhams
This was after the company's chairman Mukesh Ambani gradually focused on changing company to a tech-focussed one by launching its venture Jio. Having a huge capex-driven appetite, RIL has been able to focus on completing successful deals and acquisitions. Company's digital and the retail business expansions have become growth drivers for its share value, unlocking significant gains for shareholders in the long run.
On Jio's front, the telecom that has been under a decent spot due to higher ARPU and customer addition. After the reduction in broadband tariffs late last month, the company's aim to raise consumer market share continued after it launched more aggressive postpaid plans yesterday.
Jio's led a new price competition in the telecom industry with its launch of new postpaid plans, that were cheaper than incumbent offerings. Even after the postpaid plan of Rs399/month is a tariff increase of 100% from existing single postpaid plan of Rs199/month, Jio has had the most aggressive postpaid plans of the three operators since mid-2018.

In the latest news, RIL is in the race to acquire Debenhams, a British multinational retailer operating department stores in the UK with franchise stores in other countries. Company's growth prospects have always made investors buy the stock after any short term profit booking.
In another update, the oil conglomerate's target of selling 150 million to 200 million smartphones over two years looks achievable in the near term as the company reportedly initiated talks with assemblers to make a version of its Jio phone that would run on Google's Android and cost about Rs 4,000 ($54).
Morgan Stanley has an OW on Reliance Industries, with TP at Rs 2,247. The brokerage said,""While RIL's prepaid offering has been one of the most value-for-money offerings, we believe this should be supportive to RIL broadening the reach of its digital ecosystem, it will raise investor concerns on ARPU raise being slower than Street estimates.""

The Chinese billionaire is replaced by Zhong Shanshan, vaccine tycoon and founder of China's largest bottled water company Nongfu Spring.
According to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Zhong's net worth reached $58.7 billion on Wednesday, September 23, $2 billion more than Jack Ma's $56.7 billion.
Zhong is now Asia's second-richest person, only behind Reliance Industries Ltd's (RIL) CEO Mukesh Ambani, and the 17th wealthiest person overall, ahead of American billionaires Phil Knight and Charles Koch.

Popularly known as ""Lone Wolf"", Zhong's fortune leaped around $52 billion in 2020, more than anyone else in the world except Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla chief Elon Musk.
Both Bezos and Musk suffered massive dips in their net worth on Wednesday as tech stocks took a heavy beating.
Tesla's shares dived after its ""Battery Day"" event fell short of expectations, causing Musk's fortune to dip by almost $10 billion.
Meanwhile, the IPO (initial public offering) of Zhong's Nongfu Spring Co. emerged as Hong Kong's most popular market debut among retail investors, propelling him to China's top three richest earlier this month.

Although Zhong has outdone Ma as China's wealthiest, the tech business magnate might soon reclaim the top spot, which he has held for most of the past six years after Alibaba went public in the US."

Bharti Airtel Ltd. weighed on the gauge, with the stock sinking 7.9% after industry leader Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. unveiled a competitive new tariff plan. Reliance Industries Ltd., the parent of unlisted Jio Infocomm, added 0.9%.
“We see the offering having potential to drive at least some churn from incumbents,” said Bhupendra Tiwary, an analyst at Mumbai-based ICICI Securities Ltd.

On Wednesday, Reliance Industries Ltd said it has raised ₹5,550 crore by selling a 1.28% stake in its retail business to US private equity (PE) firm KKR and Co., as India’s most valuable company creates a war chest for its push into e-commerce.
The latest transaction, the second such in about two weeks, brings the total funding into Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) to ₹13,050 crore and follows a record ₹1,52,056 crore of investments into its digital assets unit, Jio Platforms Ltd, earlier this year.
On September 9, California-based PE fund Silver Lake picked up a 1.75% stake in RRVL for ₹7,500 crore.
Ambani, the world’s fourth-richest man, is betting his company’s future on retail and digital platforms, reducing the emphasis of its mainstay chemicals and refining business. With an eye on the rapidly growing e-commerce segment, Reliance Retail ventured into online food and grocery delivery business in May through JioMart.
The KKR investment values RRVL at an equity value of ₹4.21 lakh crore, Reliance Industries Ltd said. The private equity firm had also bought a 2.32% stake in Jio Platforms for ₹11,367 crore.
Mint on September 10 reported that RRVL is in talks with KKR to raise over ₹5,000 crore.
“We look forward to working with KKR’s global platform, industry knowledge and operational expertise across our digital services and retail businesses,” said Ambani, chairman and managing director, RIL.
Reliance Retail operates India’s largest retail business with 12,000 stores, clocking nearly 640 million footfalls.
It is the holding firm for Reliance Retail Ltd and Reliance Brands, which operates joint ventures with global brands.
As part of its new commerce strategy, Reliance Retail is onboarding small and unorganised merchants to expand its network to over 20 million.
“Reliance Retail’s new commerce platform is filling an important need for consumers and small businesses as more consumers move to shopping online and the company offers tools for kiranas to be a critical part of the value chain,” said Henry Kravis, co-founder and co-CEO of KKR.
Rupen Jhaveri, managing director, private equity, KKR India said the firm is focused on two investing themes: consumption upgrade and digital transformation.
“Our investment in Reliance Retail is predicated on their strong physical presence coupled with a solid new commerce strategy and backed by a robust supply chain infrastructure,” he said.
KKR is making the investment from its Asia private equity funds.

“Usually, it is both online and offline. If you see the past orders, you can make out the CCI considers them both together and separately,” the official said.

The first step for the competition watchdog in assessing the deal would be to define the relevant market.

“It depends on how the practice of the commission has evolved. First, a market is defined broadly, for example, the whole of retail. Then it is narrowed down to see if there are overlaps or not,” the official said.

Experts said the CCI may not have a precedent. This is a first-of-its-kind deal where both offline and online businesses are being acquired, said Kanika Chaudhary Nayar, a partner at law firm Luthra & Luthra.

“It’s not like the CCI would have too many past precedents of a similar nature and definitely not a deal where there are so many aspects to examine for the entire supply chain,” Nayar said.

In its filing, Reliance Retail said it is engaged in the business of retail supply chain management while Future Enterprises is engaged in retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses.

According to Karan Singh Chandhiok, a partner at Chandhiok & Mahajan, the CCI will determine whether the retail supply chain management includes logistics and warehousing.

“If it doesn’t, then the CCI will be less concerned about the overlaps in this market. But since it will help Reliance vertically integrate, it may examine what could be the effect on the structure of the market as a consequence,” Chandhiok said."

Here are a few details about the deal and the parties involved.
The investment values Reliance Retail at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore.
This comes after private equity giant Silver Lake Partners said on September 9 that it will invest Rs 7,500 crore in Reliance Retail, India’s biggest brick-and-mortar retail business, for a 1.75 percent stake.
Reliance Retail operates India's largest, fastest growing and most profitable retail business. Its footprint spans nearly 12,000 retail stores in over 7,000 towns with 28.7 million sq ft of retail space and having close to a 640 million footfall.
RIL, the oil-to-telecom conglomerate, is expanding its retail business through acquisitions and lining up a scrum of global investors to take on rivals such as Amazon India and Walmart-owned Flipkart in India’s huge consumer market.
This is also the second investment by KKR in a Reliance enterprise. In May, 2020, KKR said it would invest Rs 11,367 crore in Jio Platforms, the digital services platform of RIL.

Shares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea bleed after Reliance Jio introduced a new postpaid plan,Free Press Journal,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/shares-of-bharti-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-bleed-after-reliance-jio-introduced-a-new-postpaid-plan,": Wednesday, September 23, 2020, 7:11 PM IST","Shares of two large telecom players — Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd — were battered after Reliance Jio launched its new tariff plans for its postpaid customers. However, the stock of Reliance Industries (RIL) witnessed a rise mainly due to the investments RIL’s retail arm attracted.
In the case of RIL’s new postpaid plan, priced at Rs 399, it is 20 per cent cheaper than that of Airtel. However, it is the same as Vodafone Idea (VI).
Compared to Airtel and Vodafone Idea, Jio offers better data and subscriptions to various renowned OTTs. Time will tell the impact if it will have an impact on Vodafone Idea and Airtel, reports Live Mint.

According to a report by Fitch Ratings, Vodafone Idea will gradually lose market share given its weak balance sheet and limited financial flexibility. “We expect industry tariffs to rise as users adopt higher-price 4G plans.”
The report added, “We expect Jio and Bharti to increase their combined revenue market share to 75-80 per cent from around 70 per cent in the next 12-18 months, at the expense of Vodafone Idea, which will likely lose 50 million-70 million subscribers in the next 12 months; it lost about 155 million subscribers in the last nine quarters.”
Jio reported EBITDA growth of 55 per cent, while Bharti reported Indian mobile EBITDA growth of 35 per cent in the first quarter of the year ending March 2021 (FY21). In the case of Vodafone-Idea's quarterly EBITDA, it has been stagnant at USD 200 million-230 million, which covers only half of its interest cost."

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries signed 18 deals worth Rs 1.9 lakh cr since COVID-19 outbreak in India,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/mukesh-ambani-reliance-industries-signs-18-deals-since-covid-19-outbreak-india/story/416842.html,"Manoj Sharma | October 1, 2020 | Updated 08:02 IST","COVID-19 may have ravaged economies, including that of India's, but it has not been able to stop Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and MD of India's largest conglomerate, from raking in multi-billion dollar deals for his company, Reliance Industries Ltd. Ambani-led Reliance Industries has signed 18 deals worth Rs 1,90,438 crore since the first COVID-19 infused lockdown was imposed in India in March.
The deal-making process started with world's biggest social media platform, Facebook Inc, pumping in a record Rs 43,573.62 crore for 9.9 per cent stake in RIL subsidiary Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL) on April 22, making it the largest minority shareholder in the company.

  Then came the US tech investment firm Silver Lake Partners (SLP) on board, which infused Rs 5,655.75 crore in JPL for a 1.15 per cent stake on May 3. In the same month, Jio Platforms signed deals with American investment firm Vista Equity Partners (2.32 per cent stake for Rs 11,367 crore), General Atlantic (1.34 per cent stake for Rs 6,598 crore), and KKR (2.32 per cent stake for Rs 11,367 crore).

In June, Emirati state-owned holding company Mubadala, US investment firm TPG Capital, Silver Lake, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, American private equity company L Catterton and Saudi Arabia-based PIF collectively showered around Rs 37,132.2 crore in the RIL subsidiary. July marked three more deals with Intel Capital, global tech giant Google Inc, and Qualcomm Ventures for a total investment of Rs 36,661.5 crore.
In total, Jio Platforms committed Rs 1,52,056 crore for a combined stake sale of 33 per cent in JPL, with the last investment worth Rs 33,737 crore from Google in July.  
Jio Platforms came to prominence only when RIL signed the deal with FB this year, but it has since then become one of the crown jewels of Mukesh Ambani's business empire in India. However, the company was started back in 2010.

After signing up mega investment deals for Jio Platforms, Mukesh Ambani has shifted focus to Reliance Retail, another major vertical in the Reliance business. On August 19, Reliance Retail acquired a majority stake in Vitalic Health and subsidiaries, collectively known as Netmeds, for Rs 620 crore.  
After several rounds of discussions with Future Group founder Kishore Biyani, Ambani's Reliance Retail bought Future Group's retail business for Rs 24,713 crore. This would help Kishore Biyani reduce debt and save him from defaulting on loans, and in turn, helped Ambani realise his dream of making the retail business an unbeatable force in India.

After taking over 1,800 Future Group retail stores in its fold, Reliance Retail has became around seven times bigger than its closest rival, Avenue Supermarts' D'Mart retail chain.  
Now Ambani has plans to go the JPL way and raise around Rs 80,000 crore for Retail Retail to make further inroads into India's vast retail market, especially the rural India. He also aims to take the retail game to the global level to take on the likes of Walmart and Amazon.
This month alone, Reliance Retail has sold around 3.03 per cent stake in Reliance Retail for Rs 13,050 crore to the existing investors, Silver Lake Partners and KKR. Both these companies had also invested Rs 21,589 crore in Jio Platforms. While Silver Lake invested twice -- Rs 5,655 crore in May and Rs 4,567 crore in June -- in JPL, KKR infused Rs 11,367 crore on May 22.

RJio eyeing bigger foothold in postpaid with new plan launch: Reports,The Hindu Businessline,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/rjio-eyeing-bigger-foothold-in-postpaid-with-new-plan-launch-reports/article32677032.ece,"September 23, 2020","The launch of new postpaid plans by Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is its second attempt to get a foothold in this lucrative market and raise consumer market share, according to multiple brokerage reports.
RJio’s new tariff plans will be offered at a higher starting price of ₹399 per month, compared with its previous plan starting from ₹199. However, the big difference is that RJio is now offering premium content (Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar) at an affordable price, BNP Paribas said in a report.

Individually, Netflix (mobile only) costs ₹199 per month, while Prime Video and Disney+Hotstar VIP cost ₹999 and ₹399 per annum, respectively. Thus, for consumers who are looking to subscribe to these OTTs, content worth upwards of ₹300 per month is bundled in the ₹399 per month plan, it said.
On Tuesday, RJio, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani-led RIL, launched five tariff plans under its new JioPostpaid Plus. Till date, RJio had only one postpaid plan, of ₹199.
READ THE STORY: RJio expands presence in post-paid segment with JioPostpaid Plus
RIL’s bid to raise consumer market share continues after it launched aggressive postpaid plans that were cheaper than incumbent offerings, according to a Morgan Stanley report.
This comes after the reduction in broadband tariffs late last month. While RIL’s prepaid offering has been one of the most value-for-money offerings, post-paid and broadband have been areas where customer acquisition has been slower than anticipated.
“We believe this should be supportive to RIL broadening the reach of its digital ecosystem, it but will raise investor concerns on ARPU raise being slower than Street estimates,” the Morgan Stanley report added.
According to CLSA, RJio’s new post-paid plan is a tariff increase of 100 per cent from the existing plan.
“Also, while RJio’s new plan is bundling three leading OTTs but with no content exclusivity, such offers can be matched by incumbents. For all three operators, pre-paid tariffs are 55-65 per cent cheaper than post-paid, so migration by price-sensitive subscribers is unlikely. We await the consumer response to RJio’s new offers and incumbents’ retaliation. Meanwhile, sector ARPU growth presents opportunities for all telcos,” CLSA said.
“With less than 1 per cent of its subscriber base on postpaid plans, RJio has revamped its post-paid offering to gain traction in the segment. We highlight that India is largely a pre-paid market, with 95.5 per cent of the subscribers on prepaid plans. However, postpaid is a premium segment, accounting 20-25 per cent of mobile revenues of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea and is also less prone to churn,” Credit Suisse said in a report.
“Hence, we think RJio, after attaining market leadership in the prepaid segment, is now focusing on the postpaid market, as it looks to improve its ARPU (and thereby revenue) trajectory,” it added."

- The full form of the investment firm, KKR is Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Yet another KKR or rather the known KKR of India is Kolkata Knight Riders, a cricket team representing the city of Kolkata in the Indian Premier League.
- While the investment firm is founded by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, KKR franchise is owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, actress Juhi Chawla and her spouse Jay Mehta.
- The brand value of the Kolkata Knight Riders is estimated at Rs 629 crore (USD 88 million) in 2019, according to Duff & Phelps. As of September 30, 2017, Assets Under Management (AUM) is USD 153 billion. AUM means the total market value of the investments that the firm manages.
- KKR has invested in Reliance Industries, which is the owner of Mumbai Indians. And there is no need to mention that Mumbai Indians and KKR are rivals. The Mumbai Indians is the most successful IPL franchise with four championships but until Mumbai India’s third win, both teams were tied with two championships."

Ambani, the only Asian tycoon among the top 10 richest people in the world, has been able to renew investors' interest in the stock unlocking value deals with global investors in last six months.
This is despite the alarming coronavirus pandemic that has brought large economies to a standstill.
As the company builds up a dominant presence in refining, petrochemicals, telecom and retail businesses, most analysts have kept a BUY rating for the conglomerate and raised the target price to Rs 2,500.
Since the beginning of 2020, Sensex has dropped 8.5% while Reliance Industries shares have risen 46%. RIL share closed at Rs 1,500 on December 31, 2019. On Sept 22, RIL shares ended at Rs 2,211 on BSE.
While Sensex has fallen 0.74% in one year, RIL stock has risen almost 76%. The market cap of the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate stood at Rs 14,01,738.80 crore on September 21. Reliance Industries became the first Indian firm to scale market cap of Rs 16 lakh crore for the first time on September 16, 2020.
The stock hit its 52-week low of Rs 867.82 on March 23, 2020. Since then, RIL- India's most-valued company-has seen its stock jump 172% to its all-time high of Rs 2,368.80 on September 16, 2020.
Even after being rated as an overvalued stock, RIL has been among the top picks of investors and analysts with its strong franchises, partnerships and growth plans. Company's growth prospects have made investors chase the stock post any short-term profit booking.
With Reliance's highly liquid balance sheet during the tough times of pandemic, analysts believe that the stock will continue to rise in the coming quarters. RIL became debt-free this year months ahead of the March 2021 target.
In a drive to tap the fast-growing market for online shopping, RIL's recent fundraising and acquisitions have helped it not only become debt-free but also put the firm on par with global eCommerce giants such as Amazon & Walmart. The large cap stock currently trades at Rs 2,250 level on BSE.
Kotak Institutional Equities has rated 'ADD' to RIL stock at a fair value of Rs 2,256, with an upside of 5%.
While Motilal expects the TP to rise towards Rs 2,450-2,500 zones in the next few weeks and Rs 2,650-2,700 in the next few months.
Axis Securities also expects bullish momentum towards Rs 2,500-2,540.
Morgan Stanley said, ""We have an OW on Reliance Industries as we believe the company will benefit from the undercurrents in the telecom industry and increasingly foray into other digital businesses.""
The brokerage laid down Risks to Downside as 1. A potential ban on single-use plastic to hurt margins in the medium term; 2. Lower utilisation of recently started downstream energy projects; and 3. Delay in the monetisation of its energy and telecom assets.
Execution on Jio Mart, rising market share and reduced competitive intensity in the Indian telecom industry and improvement in encore energy margins were the 'Risks to Upside', as per the brokerage.
""The company bounced back sharply post hitting a low of Rs 864 on March 23, enriching its shareholders in the most spectacular way,"" said Aamar Deo Singh - Head Advisory, Angel Broking.
Reliance Industries telecom business to witness robust growth over next few years due to tariff hikes and shift of subscribers from Vodafone Idea to other telecom players, suggested Angel Broking and rated 'Accumulate' to RIL stock, at CMP of 2,306 and a TP of Rs 2,543, with an upside of 10.3%.
