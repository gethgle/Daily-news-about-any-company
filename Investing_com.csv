This weekend there was a news report about Mukesh Ambani, the infamous chairman of Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) getting fined by SEBI for 2007 manipulative trading practices. Despite the significance of such news, Reliance Industries stock prices didn’t even flinch a little. Dalal Street didn’t care! Take a look at the chart over here.



Just imagine, if the same type of news headline about a Small Cap or Mid Cap Company, What would’ve happened? The Company’s shares will be in deep red turmoil on the next second. If you think about it, you can’t help yourself but wonder about the present market situation.

By Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - India's markets watchdog fined Reliance Industries RELI.NS 250 million rupees ($3.42 million) and its chairman Mukesh Ambani 150 million rupees on Friday for what it said were fraudulent trades while selling a stake in a subsidiary in 2007.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) alleged that the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate took derivative short positions in shares of separately listed Reliance Petroleum in 2007 through third parties before it sold a 5% stake in the business.
Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for company comment and comment from Chairman Ambani.
The latest ruling follows a 2017 order https://www.reuters.com/article/us-reliance-sebi-idUSKBN16V2I0 for Reliance Industries to surrender about 4.5 billion rupees plus 12% annual interest for what the regulator said were unlawful gains from that deal. It also barred Reliance and some third parties from trading in derivatives for one year.
At the time, Reliance Industries said the trades examined by SEBI were ""genuine and bona fide transactions"" and that SEBI had ""misconstrued the true nature of the transactions and imposed unjustifiable sanctions"".
The group is awaiting a Supreme Court appeal hearing against the 2017 ruling.
""By this penalty, SEBI is showing its teeth,"" Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert and founder of proxy advisory firm InGovern, said of Friday's ruling.
""The said scheme of manipulation was deceptive and against the interest of the securities markets,"" SEBI said in Friday's 95-page order https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2021/adjudication-order-in-respect-4-entities-in-the-matter-of-reliance-petroleum-limited_48637.html, adding that Ambani was responsible for the company's activities.

Tata Steel (NS: TISC ) was trading at Rs. 527.2, up over 7% thanks to its better than expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenues came in at Rs. 37,154 crore compared to Rs. 34,579 crore for the same period in 2019. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) stood at Rs. 6,217 crore compared to Rs. 3,893 crore in 2019.

Investing.com -- Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) is India’s largest company in terms of market cap and the stock has soared a phenomenal 130% since March 2020. RIL stock began the year at Rs. 1,500 and soon fell to a 52-week low of Rs 867.4 as the Nifty and BSE Sensex plunged close to 40% due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower oil prices.
However, since then the stock has made a strong comeback and touched a record of Rs 2,369.35 in September. So what’s driven this massive surge in Reliance Industries?
Billion-dollar investments by a slew of foreign investors
Several global heavyweights have pumped in billions of dollars to get a slice of the Jio dream. Launched back in 2016, Jio is now the leading telecom operator in India and has attracted investments from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), and Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Private equity firms such as KKR and Silver Lake have also invested in Jio.
In the last six months, Reliance Industries has raised approximately Rs 170,000 crore or $23 billion in strategic investments.
However, Reliance remains an energy-focused company and generates the majority of its sales from the refining and marketing of oil. This is followed by its petrochemicals business, organized retail, telecom, and media businesses.
Is Reliance debt-free?
Mukesh Ambani previously aimed to make Reliance Industries net-debt free by the end of this fiscal year. While this idea would have seemed absurd at the start of 2020, the above investments have managed the company to attain its financial goal well before March 2021.
While Reliance still has debt on its books, the company has enough liquidity to cover its liabilities and continue to invest in growth and capital expenditure.
Reliance will be a key player in the transition towards 5G technology and the rebound in oil prices in the upcoming months coupled with its strong balance sheet should be key drivers of its stock price."

Drastic changes in the company’s business model, diversification from the Energy segment to the Retail segment are the two major themes driving the Price Action. However, from the last couple of days, we can witness a downtrend in Stock Prices; it’s a Short term downtrend. Prices have declined almost 22% from the peak value, even though it’s a drastic fall, still, it’s not a good idea to take a short trade in Reliance, at least from my point of view! Here’s why – Take a look at this Chart Analysis.

Price Action Analysis on Reliance Industries – 4h Chart


After testing the low of 1850, we can see a quick bounce back in Stock Prices. Along with that, the volume has also significantly increased. A combination of a sudden increase in the Volume and a quick bounce back in stock prices technically indicates the buying pressure on the stock.

But keep in mind, just because there is Buying pressure doesn’t mean that stock prices are going to shoot up. In order for the Buyers to take complete control over the market sentiment, Prices should break above the potential resistance at 2050 and must retest it clearly to go higher. On the other hand, a break below 1850 might push the stock prices into a further selloff or Sideways Behavior. Just keep an eye on the Price Action and Trade Accordingly in the coming days."

RIL reported standalone revenue/EBITDA of INR 563/76bn, -35/-44% YoY (in line with our estimates). Standalone APAT stood at INR 65bn, -33% YoY (HSIE est: INR 36bn). The deviation in APAT from the estimates was mainly due to the tax expense reversal on account of a reduction in the annual effective tax rate for FY21.
Standalone refining segment: Crude throughput declined 8/8% YoY/QoQ to 15.3mmt. GRM stood at USD 5.7/bbl, down from USD 6.3/bbl in 1Q. The sequential decline in the refining margin was due to lower cracks across products. RIL's GRMs outperformed Singapore GRM by USD 5.7/bbl (as against USD 7.2/bbl in 1Q).
Standalone petrochemical segment: Production during 2Q was 9.7mmt, - 2/+9% YoY/QoQ. Petchem EBITDA was INR 59bn, -33% YoY given pricing pressure because of disruptions in the local and global markets. EBITDA/t stood at INR 6,052 (vs. INR 8,839/4,860 YoY/QoQ)
RJio: Revenue grew by ~33/6% YoY/QoQ to INR 175bn. ARPU rose to INR 145 (+14/3% YoY/QoQ) while the gross/net subscriber addition was ~27/7mn. We expect ARPU to increase to INR 148/160 in FY21/22E owing to the tariff hike in Dec-19.
Reliance (NS: RELI ) Retail (RR): Recovery from the pandemic has been encouraging across categories. Revenue nearly hit base quarter levels (Rs. 411bn). 85% of stores are now operational (1Q: 50%), of which half are fully operational. Footfalls clocked 75% of pre-covid levels (vs 43% in 1Q). Consumer Electronics (CE) doubled, and Fashion & Lifestyle (F&L) tripled their toplines respectively from their 1QFY21 lows (Yet to recoup base quarter sales). Grocery and connectivity continued their strong growth momentum. EBITDAM expanded 160bp QoQ to 5.4% as the mix sharply improved in favor of the high margin CE and F&L segment.

2020-11-02 04:03","Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) announced its quarterly results on October 30, reporting a consolidated bottom-line increase of 28 percent characterized by higher revenue, higher EBITDA, and lower interest charges over the previous quarter.

With strong quarterly figures, the business operations are seen to be approaching the pre-Covid levels for most operating segments. As per the chairman Mukesh Ambani, retail buying has returned to normalcy for key consumer products with the easing of lockdowns. The company has witnessed a sharp recovery across its Order-to-Cash (O2C) business processes.

The shape of consolidated quarterly numbers

Higher revenue over the previous quarter was on the account of favorable oil prices and retail business rebound. Retail stores experienced more footfalls with the lockdowns easing but the retail operations are still eyeing the impulsive customer purchases to push the retail numbers over pre-Covid levels.

Retail and digital services contributed 85 percent of the incremental consolidated EBITDA for the quarter. The weak oil refining numbers were offset by an improved performance by the petrochemical segment. Petrochemicals and oil products demand materialized into a 34.6 percent increase in the EBITDA for the segment. The company achieved record quarterly EBITDA for the digital services arm.

The decrease in finance costs was supported by fulfilling the higher cost obligations in advance. The acquisition of Reliance Holdings USA (RHUSA) partially increased finance costs. While the outstanding debt for the quarter ending was Rs 279,251 crores, funds raised and receivables stood in excess of outstanding debt. The enterprise value of the firm appreciated significantly with a massive inflow of capital in the form of equity investments and strategic partnerships.

How did the individual segments perform?

Reliance Jio – Digital Services

Reliance Jio revenue (7.2 percent QoQ) and EBITDA (8.7 percent QoQ) increased sequentially over the previous quarter with a slight increase in EBITDA margin. However, the segment reported a 19.8 percent net profit for the quarter under review.

With a customer base of 405 million subscribers, Reliance Jio became the only operator outside China to cross the 400 million subscriber mark by catering to a single country market. While the wireless line of operations witnessed a strong increase in the subscriber base, the monthly churn rate stood increased due to the impact of the pandemic on recharge cycles.

The more exciting development took place in the 5G space as Jio in collaboration with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) achieved a speed of over 1gbps using Reliance 5G solutions. Jio Platforms continued its development on building 5G infrastructure.

JioUPI completed its pan-India rollout with full integration with the BHIM UPI application.

Reliance Retail

Reliance Retail showed a phenomenal increase of 85 percent in the EBITDA for the quarter over the previous one. Revenue of the segment was the same as compared to last year despite stores working at a partial capacity. The increase in revenue implies a rebound in retail buying. Higher EBITDA growth stems from a low base factor, but the EBITDA margin also recovered from 3.8 previous quarter to 5.5 percent for the current quarter implying prompt cost management.

The retail figures point to a V-shaped recovery as the segment will be testing the pre-Covid level of operations.

The grocery line witnessed strong momentum with recovery in electronics and clothing lines as well. The company entered the pharma retail market and continued expanding its digital capabilities across consumption products. With consumer electronics posting twice the revenue than that of the previous quarter, the electronics growth is expected to continue through the third quarter with festive buying in effect.

Reliance Retail also ramped up its digital platforms to support online-buying and sustain competition. JioMart was able to leverage the strong demand for groceries driven by demand for staples and processed food during the lockdown.

Reliance – Petrochem, Refining and Marketing, Oil and Gas Exploration and Media

Petrochemicals segment delivered a strong performance on the back of a recovery in operating levels with some of the company’s crackers working at 100 percent utilization. The growth was driven by improvement in demand, which was led by restricted supply during the lockdown period. Segment revenue for the quarter was Rs 29,665 crores, which is 17.8 percent higher than the previous quarter. The revenue was mainly boosted by an increase in prices across the product line. The EBITDA margin of 20.1 percent was supported by efficient cracker mechanics and increasing PVC margins.

The company achieved the highest quarterly polymer domestic sales and polyester sales also picked up with the easing of lockdown. The revival of the auto, agriculture, and construction sectors is to drive further growth of the petrochemical segment.

The refining and marketing segment reported strong revenue growth (up 33 percent QoQ) supported increasing in the global oil demand and prices in the second quarter. However, the higher revenue numbers were offset by weak segment EBITDA which declined by 21.4 percent over the previous quarter. The company cited the higher cost of crude oil and lower-middle distillate cracks as the reason for the decline in the segment EBITDA.

The oil and gas exploration segment experienced a decline in production and favorable price realization that led to a revenue decline of 29.8 percent QoQ for the segment.

The media segment reported a revenue of Rs 1,061 crores (31.5 percent QoQ) and an EBITDA of Rs 166 crores (514.8 percent QoQ). Revenues from advertising and improved margins for broadcasting proved to be the growth factors of the segment. The segment continued to experience healthy subscription numbers that ultimately converted into increased television viewership. MoneyControl and Voot reported growth in subscribers for paid content.

Capital Financing and Strategic Partnerships

Reliance Industries facilitated the largest fundraising in India during the lockdown period and continued to attract capital from all over the globe. The capital was financed by a rights issue of Reliance shares and asset monetization. The funds received combined with receivables have taken the net debt levels to below zero.

Jio Platforms received investment from behemoths such as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, Silver Lake, and Qualcomm Ventures.

The regulatory authorities are deliberating over the potential acquisition of the Future Group’s retail and wholesale business by Reliance Retail
RRVL acquired a controlling stake in Netmeds
The overall quarterly results of RIL signal a sharp recovery in just six months after the pandemic made itself known. With the economy opening up and consumer spending returning to normalcy, the company stands to capitalize on demand revival. More importantly, the company showcased a robust balance sheet with the ability to sustain uncertainty in the near future.

Investing.com -- The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact in the Americas and Europe as the number of cases has started rising up again. The COVID-19 cases in Europe have crossed the 10 million mark and countries like the UK, France, and Spain have once again imposed total or partial lockdowns. The U.S. is seeing a record surge in cases that is killing up to 1,000 people a day.
This new spike in cases has led to a massive drop in oil prices. Crude Oil WTI Futures that was trading at $40 in October is now below $35 levels. Brent Crude is between $36-$37 levels.
The drop in oil has affected markets in India with the Nifty trading at 11,616, down 0.23%, and the BSE trading at 39,555, down 0.14% at 11:10 AM.
Reliance (NS: RELI ) Industries fell over 5% as it reported a 15% fall in quarterly profit on Friday, October 30. Even though the number was higher than analyst estimates, the share is trading lower because of the drop in oil prices.
RIL accounts for almost 13.24% of the Nifty 50 and over 16% in the BSE Sensex . Any movement in its price affects both indices. Indian Oil (NS: IOC ) Corporation was also trading down 0.82% at the time of this report."

Will Reliance Industries Be The Next General Electric? - Investing.com India,Investing.com,https://in.investing.com/analysis/will-reliance-industries-be-the-next-general-electric-200441533,Will Reliance Industries Be The Next General Electric?,"Stock Market Analysis
2020-07-06 12:59
Editors Pick","Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) is the largest company in India, and so was General Electric (NYSE: GE ) in the US during the year, 2000. Like General Electric; Reliance is not a pure-play business, it has many divisions, which requires extensive management. Though RIL has now turned net-debt free, the retail segment in the near future is likely to incur additional expenses, while contributing little to the company’s overall revenue.

Even though GE’s current management is trying hard to turn the company around, the coronavirus has impacted GE's aviation unit; a unit that is crucial to the company's profitability. GE's aviation unit makes airplane engines for Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus, and is GE's most profitable division, generating $32.9 billion in revenue for the company in 2019. That's 34% of total revenues. With travel having been ground to a halt during the virus pandemic, airplane companies aren't ordering new planes or plane parts. GE's aviation unit is in the process of laying off 10% of its U.S. workforce as of March 2020. Coming back to Reliance Industries; the near future looks good for the conglomerate, however, things may go downhill if extensive supervision and excellent financial position are not maintained as General Electric’s problems began due to debt, and even now GE’s balance sheet is considered very opaque. The good thing with RIL is that the company’s balance sheet is in great condition at the moment, stakeholders need not worry currently, but need to remain cautious for the long term.

As it is the case with every company, for expanding operations, capital is required, which is often procured by way of debt. From this point forward, RIL cannot turn back and take on debt to finance projects, they have to remain net debt-free to win and maintain stakeholder confidence. This ultimately is a concern as the company might not be able to capitalize on opportunities as it could have with the easily accessible debt.

RIL though already a stable company seems to be stabilizing even more, by reducing debt, which ultimately means – prioritizing on making the current businesses grow and improving the overall company’s efficiency and profit margins. RIL has too many moving parts. And unlike some pure-play companies that do not require constant supervision; Reliance Industries would need consistent direction and sound management at all times to remain on track, which can turn into the GE of India in the near future.

GE, it is certainly not running out of business yet, but there’s serious work to be done. General Electric was the part of the Dow for more than 100 years and was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA ) in June 2018. When most people think “GE,” they probably think about light bulbs, televisions, and washing machines. GE was born out of the race to provide affordable light and electricity to fuel the growth of industrial America and quickly became a household name. As of February 2020, shares have fallen a whopping 59% since January 2017, when the company announced it would cut 12,000 jobs. The company’s market cap, which stood at $262 billion at the time, has fallen significantly to less than $100 billion."

2020-06-29 04:33
Editors Pick","Of late, Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) has been the talk of the town as the firm has inked several new investment deals which have led to its share price rallying. However, for the past one week, the stock’s price has been stuck in a box range pattern which I believe will determine the equity’s future trend. Thus, I will give a breakdown of what levels short term traders ought to watch and what levels long term traders ought to track.
Short term traders have the potential of making a quick return from the equity in the coming sessions. This is as the stock in the short term is stuck between the bulls and the bears as Reliance Industries is trading within a box range pattern. The key resistance zone short term traders ought to monitor is between Rs 1,781 and Rs 1,798. Whilst, the key support zone is between Rs 1,694 and Rs 1,677. In the short term if the stock were to break the resistance level at Rs 1,798 then we can expect a quick up move until Rs 1,853. But, if the stock were to break the support level at Rs 1,677, then the stock can be shorted until the support zone at Rs 1,597. 
 
Moreover, on Friday, the equity made a decent comeback after having four bearish trading sessions. Thus, short term traders can use a break of Friday’s high to aim for the top of the box range or a break of last week’s low as a sign to short the stock until the box range support zone. But, do keep a keen eye on the intraday chart patterns as the market has been very volatile in the past few weeks. Moreover, one positive I saw on Friday was that most large-cap stocks in the equity market saw a decent level of profit booking. However, the profit booking level seen in Reliance Industries was negligible, which is a positive sign for the stock.
 
Medium and long-term investors are not in the game of catching smaller moves. The critical support zone these investors ought to monitor is at Rs 1,597. This is as the level is an important support zone on multiple timeframes, plus many technicals are converging around this price zone. Thus, as long as the equity maintains itself above this price level, it can be categorized as being in a strong uptrend. If it were to break this level with a bearish pattern, then I would advise investors to book their profits. On the upside, if the stock were to break the resistance level at Rs 1,811 then investors can add in some more capital with a price target of Rs 2,095.
 
On the whole, Reliance Industries is in a strong uptrend. Thus, the current hiccup in the stock price is due to the market condition rather than a stock-specific issue. This is as the Nifty and Sensex are in a dicey position. Therefore, there is still a lot of potential left in the stock for long-term traders as the upswing momentum is still strong. 
 
Good luck trading.

With these current actions that the company has initiated its debt would reduce significantly.

Though the company’s quarterly results are not so appealing but looking at its yearly performance and constant endeavor of the company to be the best version of themselves every day is what makes it attractive buy with a target price of INR 1800."

2020-06-04 06:30","MUMBAI, June 4 (Reuters) - India's oil-to-telecoms giant Reliance Industries RELI.NS on Wednesday closed a $7 billion rights issue, India's largest ever, luring buyers in with a rare deferred payment offer.
Proceeds from the issue, also ranked as one of the world's biggest by a non-financial company based on Dealogic data, will aid Reliance's plan to slash net debt to zero this year.
The issue was subscribed about 1.6 times, in ""a vote of confidence, by both domestic investors, foreign investors and small retail shareholders, in the intrinsic strength of the Indian economy"", billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani said a statement late on Wednesday.
Reliance launched the issue last month, offering existing shareholders one new share for 15 held at a discounted price of 1,257 rupees ($17) apiece.
Investors could pay only a quarter of the price upfront, and the rest in two instalments until November 2021.
Also, in a first, Reliance said the partly paid up shares could be traded on stock exchanges, giving investors a chance to buy more of the discounted issue than the entitlement and making it an attractive bet for arbitrage players.
The shares will be allotted on June 10 and listed on the exchanges on June 12, the conglomerate has said.
India is coming out of a two-month nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus that has brought economic activity to a standstill, with markets correcting sharply and deal activity slowing to a trickle.
Still, in the past six weeks, Reliance's digital business - known as Jio Platforms - has raised a staggering $10 billion from global investors, including Facebook FB.O and private equity like Silver Lake and KKR & Co Inc KKR.N .
The funds are set to help Reliance eliminate its $21.4 billion net debt this year.
With a crash in oil prices, Reliance's shares hit a two-year low late March. Since then, the deal spree and the rights issue have propelled shares to a near record high, trading at 1,570 rupees at 0600 GMT on Thursday.
Promoters - as controlling stakeholders are called in India - hold a little over 50% of Reliance. ($1 = 75.4550 Indian rupees)"

NEW DELHI, May 22 (Reuters) - KKR & Co Inc KKR.N will invest $1.5 billion in Reliance Industries ' RELI.NS Jio Platforms, its biggest investment in Asia to date and bringing the amount of new funds raised by the Indian digital company this month to a massive $10 billion.
Jio Platforms, which houses movie, music apps and telecoms venture Jio Infocomm, has now sold a combined stake of just over 17% in five fundraising deals led by Facebook Inc FB.O which spent $5.7 billion to take 9.99%.
The deals highlight Jio Platforms' potential to become the dominant player in India's digital economy. The telecoms unit has already decimated several rivals with cut-throat pricing, while it can count on Reliance's retail network to expand e-commerce. It is also working on connected cars, security systems and smart homes.

2020-05-19 03:12","Technical Analysis of Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) Limited; bulls are rejecting the present price level
A company that founded in the late 1960s got confirmation of its name as Reliance Industries Limited in 1985. In the beginning years of RIL, Shri Dhirubhai H. Ambani who is the founder; gave it shape as a petrochemical major, started as a textile manufacturer, is today considered as India's largest private sector company on all major financial parameters. In 2004, Reliance Industries (RIL) became the first Indian private sector organization to be listed in the Fortune Global 500 list. The company runs world-class manufacturing facilities across the country at Allahabad, Hazira, Barabanki, Nagothane, Dahej, Hoshiarpur, Nagpur, Patalganga, Naroda, Silvassa, Jamnagar, and Vadodara. Today RIL’s business activities span across hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail, and telecommunications. In this article, the emphasis is on finding out the best possible information which could highlight the price movement of RIL in the coming months. To start with my assessment is the price of RIL has a higher chance of attempting a correction in its price pattern. This assessment is based on different technical analysis and the chart pattern. The technical report is explained in details as follows:
Fig.-1: Monthly Chart
Source: www. in.investing.com
From the above Fig. 1 it is very well observed that in May 2020 the high price level is Rs. 1494.95 and the lifetime high is at Rs. 1617.55. In the mid of April 2020, RIL decided to bring Rights Issue and this news came in every newspaper and this news kept the price up. Throughout April 2020 the price did not go down but in early May when the price touched the lifetime high the selling started coming and failed to sustain at that price level. On 11th May 2020, the price reached Rs. 1615.00, and after 10.30 AM the price kept on continuously falling since then. The following Fig. 2 indicates that the RIL price started moving up in the 4th week of March 2020, and it kept on moving till 11th May 2020 with a strong buying presence.
Fig.-2: Weekly Chart
Source: www. in.investing.com
The above Fig. 2 indicates that the trend angle in the weekly chart started to decrease as it progressed to this week. This is an indication that the RIL price is losing strength over the period; this otherwise establishes the fact that the buyers at the present moment are not interested in buying the stock at the current price level. Therefore, the price of RIL is going to get a steep correction over the first quarter of the present financial year.
Fig.-3: Daily Chart
Source: www. in.investing.com
From the above Fig. 3, you will find there are five moving averages that are available, and four each short-term moving average is crossing each corresponding long-term moving average. Fig. 3 figures out that the 5-day moving average started crossing the 50-day moving average there was a gap up opening of around 80 points that took place, and that was the place where 15/20/30 moving averages crossed the 50-day moving average from down to upward. But in this time frame though the price increased and the speed of growth came down as well as it is observed that the confusion amongst the buyers is clearly visible at the upper wick of the candles these days. This is an indication that the buyers are not bullish to keep on buying at that level. Therefore, there is a greater possibility that the RIL price may witness a sharp fall in the price of the stock.
Fig.-4: Daily Chart of MA, MACD, and RSI


Source: www. in.investing.com
The above Fig. 4 combinedly shows Moving Average, MACD and RSI. You can see in Fig. 4 the MACD line and the trigger line are becoming narrowing down and moving upward with the possible convergence which shows the buying intention is becoming weaker in comparison to the selling pressure. At the same time, the RSI line has touched the 70-mark line that indicated the over purchase zone. It is observed at his RSI level the price of any stock takes little breath and distribution of price takes place and once that level completes the share price starts falling. In this case, the RSI shows the possible future fall in the RIL price. Thus, it can be articulated that the MA, MACD, RSI daily chart pattern combinedly indicates the possible fall in the RIL stock.
The following Fig. 5 combinedly shows EMA, MACD, and RSI. The chart pattern very well defines the possible future distribution of price at the upper level with a big upper wick. You can see when the 10-day and 20-day EMA started crossing the 30-day EMA the gap up opening took place with higher volume but next day small green body formed followed by the next day's green candle in which the upper wick was bigger than that of the body. Shows the rejection of buying interest among the bulls.
Fig.-5: Daily Chart of Bollinger Band, MA, MACD, and RSI


Source: www. in.investing.com
The above chart represents the price pattern in a daily time frame. In this situation, the upper line of the Bollinger Band represents the resistance level of the RIL’s price. You can see that the price failed to go beyond the upper band of the Bollinger Band, this indicates the price rejection at the upper band on 11th May, which is an indication that the price may not go beyond Rs. 1615.00 level.

Fig.-6: Daily Moving Average Chart
Source: www. in.investing.com
The above Fig. 6 highlights that the RIL’s price failed to go beyond Rs. 1615.00 level and it slipped below Rs. 1460.00 level on 14th May 2020. At that time the MACD line also crossed the signal line in the daily price chart. This is a confirmation of the possible future downward movement of the RIL’s price. The following Fig. 7 highlights that the RIL’s price movement on 14th May 2020 closed below the uptrend line as well as on 15th the price closed above the opening price but failed to cross the previous day’s opening price. This shows an indication that the RIL’s share price has a greater possibility that it may get distributed at that price range and may take downward movement after 20th May 2020 once the rights Issue completes. There is a greater possibility that the RIL’s price may fall beyond Rs. 1412.00 level. Since it gets strong support at that level, if it breaches that level there is a greater possibility that the price may fall further and approach Rs. 1179.00 mark. The MACD chart also confirms this price pattern.

2020-05-04 10:12","Yep! Its Reliance once again – Reliance Industry Share prices are technically in an Uptrend since March. Share prices have rallied so far from 900 to 1500 and some market participants are wondering what’s going on in the Stock. The Short term Uptrend is clearly visible on 2h and 4h timeframe.

But the recent signs of “overextension” within the Uptrend and the overall negative market sentiment might spark a Trend Reversal in the stock. Take a look at this Chart Analysis.

Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) – Short Term Uptrend

Reliance share prices are rallying higher because of speculation over the recent decisions and business activities undertaken by the Management. One of the most cited reasons behind the rally is the business deal that happened between Jio and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Another important point is the constant measures taken by the company to cut its debt from the Balance sheet. These two factors seem to be influencing the Investor’s behavior so far. In a simple sense, we can say that Uptrend in Reliance is a result of Speculation over the future prospects of Business.

But given the current circumstances and negative market sentiment, the Uptrend might be short-lived. Even the Price behavior is showing the signs of overextension in the Uptrend – a tendency of price movement to revert back to the mean value after 2 – 3 consequent rallies.

So based on these factors, we can say there is a good possibility of Trend Reversal in the Stock. The trend could either reverse into a Range or it might altogether turn into an opposite trend. In either way, we can expect some potential trading opportunities in upcoming days.

Hence Traders should keep an eye on the Price Action of Reliance Industries and must avoid taking positions impulsively. Execute trades only if there’s a proper setup with good risk-reward. In case of any strong positive catalyst, we need to change our bias and expectation.

2020-05-04 02:31","This week the Indian financial market is going to be hammered by a torrent of news and economic data which if put bluntly will result in many short and long traders getting whipsawed if they aren’t nimble enough. Moreover, at the time of writing this article, the SGX Nifty is roughly 500 points down and all I can say is that most long traders on Monday morning will receive a surprise colonoscopy. Furthermore, the Manufacturing PMI data will be released today and is expected to fall to the 41.0 level as per the forecast given by Investing.com. Thus, we can expect the market to absorb the negativity until that point, but if the statistic comes below that, then we will be in for one quick plunge. However, as of now, we are still trading in the box range thus technically a sideways pattern.

Unlike my customary Monday morning articles where I look at the indexes, today I shall look at two stocks that are darlings of the retail trading segment. Nevertheless, the index levels have been shared on my Twitter handle and my free Telegram channel. I have done this as the price movements in the index are presently very quick hence the levels need to be updated daily which is easier to do via social media rather than penning a new article every day.

Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ):
Reliance Industries results can be classified as a mixed bag of numbers. This is as the results of Jio and the retail segment are positive. I say this as Jio’s average revenue per user has risen plus the retail segment has been able to maintain its margins despite the lockdown. However, the oil business did not do very well as the recent drop seen in crude prices coupled with the coronavirus related demand shock caused the margins in the segment to plunge. Furthermore, the firm announced a right’s issue worth Rs 53,000 crore which will speed up the deleveraging cycle. Moreover, it makes Mukesh Ambani’s intent of making Reliance industries a zero-debt company by 2021 look believable.

Coming to the technicals Reliance Industries has reached a resistance level and the first signs of the stock being on tenuous grounds surfaced on 24th April. Hence, any investor who wants to go long ought to only do so once it breaks the Rs 1,507 resistance level. However, the traders who want to short the stock can use the support range between Rs 1,302 and Rs 1,339 as an initial price target. If the stock breaks below the above-mentioned support range, then traders can short the stock until the support zone at Rs 1,185.

HDFC AMC:
HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd (NS: HDFA ) is equity that has given investors an excellent return over the past few years as it was constantly on a rise. However, the stock’s rallying spirit has hit a speed bump this year as the market collapsed. Moreover, the situation was worsened for the asset management sector as in March the closure rate of SIPs rose to 70%. Furthermore, if that was not bad enough, the cessation of six funds run by Franklin Templeton gave the industry another jolt as it triggered a fear of redemptions. Additionally, another issue AMC stocks have been facing is that they have technically been underperforming when compared to the benchmark returns as most of their fund managers have been dysfunctional in picking quality trades.

Hence, due to the industry’s dire fundamentals, I do not believe we will see a sizeable turnaround in the equity anytime soon. Moreover, if the stock were to have a close below the Rs 2,357 level then we can expect the equity to fall to the Rs 2,070 price zone. Unfortunately, traders cannot positionally short the stock as it is not in the futures and options segment. However, traders can still profit from descent on an intraday basis by trading it in the MIS cash segment.

Overall, all signs point to a bearish start of the week. This is as the bears have been knocking on the door for quite some time but on Monday, they will finally re-enter the scene. Hence, I believe Monday’s trading session will be very important in deciding the longer-term trend but that fully depends on the end of the day chart pattern. Thus, I will update readers on the pattern after the market closes via Twitter. Lastly, the government’s constant promises about a stimulus plan seem to be now falling on deaf ears. This is as they have always been holding meetings but failing to come up with any concrete strategy. Hence, in my opinion, if they do not provide a concrete solution in the coming days then we will be back into a descent. Thus, the ball is now in the finance ministry’s court so let’s see if they can manage to pull up a plan that will be adequate enough to appease the stock market.

Good luck trading.

By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd RELI.NS said it will consider its first rights issue in almost 30 years when its board meets on Thursday, in another attempt to slash its debt.
In an exchange filing late on Monday the oil-to-retail conglomerate said a rights issue would be on the table at the meeting although it gave no details of what exactly was under consideration.
The discussions come after Facebook FB.O revealed plans to spend $5.7 billion to buy a 9.99% stake in Reliance's digital arm, raising questions about why the Indian company would need to raise addi0tional capital through a rights offer. rights issue is a surprise, considering that they are getting equity infusion from Facebook,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer at Axis Securities.
""There will be some dilution because of the issue, but it is difficult to gauge at this point in time how much the stock will fall because the quantum is not known.""
Several analysts however said a rights issue would be a positive development reflecting the confidence of management and their commitment to eliminating Reliance's net debt of about $22 billion by March 2021.
""It reflects promoter's unflinching faith in the medium to long term prospects of various businesses,"" said Ajay Bodke, chief executive at Prabhudas Lilladher, a portfolio management service company.
Reliance shares rose as much as 1.8% in early trade following the announcement, later falling in line with the broader market. At 0625 GMT, the shares were trading down 1.7%.
Promoters - as controlling stakeholders are called in India - hold a little over 50% of Reliance and would likely infuse their own funds into the company if they want to retain their stake at current levels.
Reliance had hoped to pocket nearly $15 billion by offloading a 20% stake in its refining and petrochemicals arm to Saudi Aramco (SE: 2222 ), in a deal which was due to be closed by March but now could be shelved amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
One analyst who declined to be named said Reliance may be looking at a rights issue as the Aramco deal appeared to be in doubt.
Reliance acquired huge amounts of debt when it bought into the telecom sector with the launch of Jio, which began operations in late 2016 with free voice and cut-price data, triggering consolidation in an overcrowded sector."

By Sankalp Phartiyal and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU, April 22 (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O is set to spend $5.7 billion to buy a 9.99% stake in Reliance Industries ' RELI.NS digital arm, as it looks to roll out services for India's grocers and small businesses by capitalizing on WhatsApp's extensive reach in the country.
The deal announced on Wednesday is Facebook's biggest since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014 and will give the Menlo Park, California-based firm a stake in Jio Platforms - the digital services entity that houses Reliance's telecoms arm Jio Infocomm, as well as its news, movie and music apps, along with other businesses.
The transaction is also the eighth largest deal in Asia this year based on deal value, according to Refinitiv data, and comes at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has stifled mergers and acquisitions activity globally.
To kick off the partnership, Facebook's WhatsApp messenger, which counts India as its biggest market with about 400 million users, will help fuel the growth of Jio's new retail venture, JioMart, the two companies said.
""In the near future JioMart ... and WhatsApp will empower nearly 30 million small Indian kirana (grocery) shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighborhood,"" Mukesh Ambani, Reliance chairman and Asia's richest man, said in a video statement.
JioMart, the e-commerce venture of Reliance's retail arm, offers customers free express grocery deliveries from neighbourhood mum-and-pop stores. It is yet to be launched across India, and is likely to pose a formidable challenge to Amazon.com's AMZN.O local unit and Walmart (NYSE: WMT )'s WMT.N Flipkart, which are also betting big on groceries to grow.
For Reliance, the deal will help the oil-to-retail group, which bet over $30 billion on the Jio telecoms venture, reduce its debt load.
FACEBOOK INDIA ROADMAP
The companies said the potential benefits of the deal were manifold, but shied away from giving details.
""We will really look to explore multiple areas of collaboration,"" Ajit Mohan, the India head of Facebook, told journalists on a call. ""And the spirit of it will be - can we open new doors? Can we open new avenues?""
The investment, according to tech and retail analysts, will give Facebook new means to expand in India, its biggest market outside of the United States.
Facebook's offerings such as WhatsApp Business, which allows businesses to catalogue products and send automated replies, and a payment service, could be handy tools for millions of small retailers and customers that Reliance wants to tie together.
The alliance with Jio, which has over 380 million subscribers, could also help WhatsApp evolve into an Indian version of Chinese internet giant Tencent's 0700.HK WeChat, which allows users to chat, make payments and book flights and hotels, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
""The idea is to turn the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ecosystem into something like that. What Facebook don't want to do is go out and deal with the physical task of building warehouses, keeping inventory. They don't want to be a Walmart or an Amazon,"" the source added, declining to be identified as details of the deal were private.
RELIANCE'S SWAY
The perceived closeness between Reliance chairman Ambani - who has net worth of $49.2 billion, according to Forbes - and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could also ease Facebook's struggles in country which has taken Big Tech to task over issues such as misinformation and data privacy, sources said.
WhatsApp's payments service has been awaiting regulatory clearances for nearly two years, and India has previously blamed WhatsApp for the spread of misinformation and fake news.
Facebook's Mohan, however, played down the idea of the deal being aimed at smoothing regulatory issues, saying it was squarely focused on meeting the needs of small business owners.
Reliance has always pitched Jio as a technology company and it is using its financial muscle to build smart homes, which could rival Amazon's Alexa-based solutions, connected cars and security systems. For all of those, it could potentially tap into Facebook's tech prowess.
""They (Reliance) have great ambition. As they try to build a retail business on top of the core Jio base, this deal provides them with a mechanism for not having to go through a hit and trial method, but leverage some technologies that are proven,"" said Atul Kunwar, a former Chief Technology officer at one of India's biggest IT firms, Tech Mahindra TEML.NS .
Shares in Reliance ended 10% higher after rising as much as 12% earlier on the news, contributing nearly half the gains on the NSE Nifty 50 index on Wednesday.
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) acted as financial adviser for Reliance, while AZB & Partners and Davis Polk & Wardwell acted as legal counsel. Facebook was advised by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC )."

The company’s market capitalization fell by Rs. 99,430.93 crores to Rs. 8,42,262.64 crore which was one of the highest losses in one day of the share. The Coronavirus fears have triggered a global sell-off sentiment in the market resulting in the downfall of market prices of almost every stock listed.
The following Ichimoku cloud indicator shows an upward trend for the company’s price movements by the formation of a green cloud. Even though the Chikou span line is signifying a downward trend for the stock, the following changes are whipsaw effects due to the global scenario which is affecting the multinational companies throughout the world. The company’s share price had hit its all-time high price of Rs.1609.95 when the Union Budget 2020 was announced and a bullish trend was continued with the change in price. The Indian conglomerate has been restructuring its business operations slowly which would ensure a better position and exposure for its subsidiaries.
Reliance Industries (NS: RELI ) have also infused 500 crores by acquiring a 37.7% stake in Alok Industries (NS: ALOK ).

The decline in the price of the share is a part of price correction movements of the market which would be stabilized in the upcoming trading sessions and resulting in a bullish trend."
